2021-02-21,"TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. You've heard the name Naomi Wolf before. She has been a prominent person in this country and a prominent Democrat for more than 30 years. Wolf is one of the founders of third wave feminism. She worked for Bill Clinton. She advised Al Gore famously. Late last year she voted for Joe Biden. You've almost certainly seen her book. She's written a lot of them. A couple of years ago, we criticized Naomi Wolf by name on this show. We didn't think we agreed on much to put it mildly. Yet less than a week after the last election, Wolf surprised a lot of people by tweeting this, quote: ""If I'd known Biden was open to lockdowns as he now states, which is something historically unprecedented in any pandemic and a terrifying practice, one that won't ever end because elites love it. I would never have voted for him."" Wow. Where did that come from? And more to the point, how did a faithful lifelong Democrat reach that conclusion? Maybe because whatever her preconceptions, Naomi Wolf has been paying attention. And that's true for a lot of us actually, regardless of who we voted for. People who have been watching carefully may find they have very different views than the views they once had, and the reason for that is simple. Reality itself is changing very fast. All over the world, countries that once seemed like bulwarks of traditional liberal values: freedom of assembly, property rights, freedom of speech and conscience, have suddenly abandoned their long standing traditions of protecting the individual and now resemble police states. It's not an overstatement. The change has been sudden, and it's been dramatic and the pretext for it, of course, has been COVID. Consider Canada, our sprawling ice covered neighbor to the north. Not so long ago, Canada was considered such a stable and restrained place that its main problem was being uninteresting. Nothing seemed to happen there. The great white waste of time, they called it. Not anymore. Since COVID arrived, the Canadian authorities bear no resemblance to the taciturn Mounties, you may remember. They act like Burmese generals putting down a coup, nothing is too harsh for their own citizens. This footage, for example was shot New Year's Eve in the Canadian city of Gatineau. A group of friends gathered in a private home. No one was selling fentanyl, no one plotting a homicide. Just a group of relentlessly polite Canadians celebrating the New Year. Apparently somebody called the police and here's what happened next. CARLSON: That's pretty shocking, but what happened after that maybe worse than the footage you just saw. The police fined everyone at the gathering $1,500.00 apiece and then they arrested the owner of the home. Now, he wasn't charged with attacking a cop or spreading COVID, which no one claimed he did. No. His crime was described as quote, ""refusing to provide personal information to the authorities."" So they barged into his home and when he didn't answer the right questions quickly enough, they arrested him. Now that is not a public health measure. It is intentional humiliation, but the humiliation didn't stop there. You may have noticed that some of the police officers you just saw on that video were not wearing masks themselves. So in other words, the cops who claimed the people inside were violating Corona law were themselves in violation of it. When sharp eyed people on social media pointed this out, the police in Gatineau explained they didn't have to follow public health laws, because it was a public health emergency. So just to show you how serious they are about stopping COVID, Canadian Police were willing to spread COVID themselves. That's what they said. Canada's so called Liberal Party didn't have a problem with any of this, neither the supposedly liberal Prime Minister. No one in Canada seemed to; and not just Canada, the entire Anglosphere is moving toward authoritarianism that nobody seems to be noticing. In the formerly free U.K. last week, a group of people in West Midlands created what authorities later described as -- and if you've got kids, we want to warn you this could be shocking -- a quote ""makeshift club"" with the bar VIP area and a dance room with a DJ. Yes, a DJ. So naturally, the authority sprang into action. They dispatched a thermal imaging helicopter. They kicked down doors. It was a threat worse than ISIS and they acted like it. CARLSON: Did we say this was happening in the Anglosphere? No. If only. A similar scene played out in Madrid this weekend. You're seeing the images right now. A police raided on an unauthorized party forced the people inside into closets and cupboards hiding under mattresses. Madrid's police later released a statement admonishing residents, quote, ""We keep asking you for collaboration and responsibility."" Now even allowing for the translation from the Spanish, that is Orwellian, but it probably no longer shocks you. You've been living with less dramatic versions of this for nearly a year. There may be less door kicking going on in this country, but the result is the same -- traumatized citizens and destroyed lives. Listen to this gym owner in San Francisco explain what has happened to her livelihood under the lockdown regime. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Danielle Rabkin owns CrossFit Golden Gate. She is in a lot of debt. DANIELLE RABKIN, OWNER, CROSSFIT GOLDEN GATE: I've been a business owner for eight and a half years. I've been running this business. It's been leveled to the ground. I've actually thought about leaving the city. I'm watching the city burn to the ground. I'm watching all of my members leave. I don't have much of a reason to stay anymore. My business has been completely decimated. Show me the data, the contact tracing data that shows transmission is happening there and then I will close my doors. Until then, let me earn a living. CARLSON: Daniel Rabkin, just an American citizen, nobody cares what she thinks, ""Let me earn a living,"" she says. I used to resonate, the ability to work was once considered a human right, one of the most basic human rights, but then a lot of things were once considered basic human rights. Remember my body, my choice. You've heard people chant that for 50 years. As recently as 2019, Kamala Harris endorsed that idea. KAMALA HARRIS (D), VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Women have been given the responsibility to perpetuate the human species. Our bodies were created to do that. And it does not give any other person the right to tell a woman what to do with that body. It is her body. It is her right. It is her decision. CARLSON: Yes, it's your body. It's your right. Oh, sorry. COVID. Actually, it is Bill Gates's body now. Bill Gates isn't God, just a big shareholder in Microsoft. But since COVID, Bill Gates has gained extraordinary powers over what you can and cannot do to your own body. Bill Gates would like you to take the coronavirus vaccine. That's not a request. If you don't comply, you could lose your job. Think we're exaggerating. Listen to this waitress from Brooklyn.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice over): The 34-year-old says she was fired after telling her employer she and her husband are considering starting a family and she had hesitations about getting the COVID-19 vaccine. QUESTION: What's your biggest reservation about getting the vaccine? BONNIE JACOBSON, FIRED FROM JOB FOR NOT TAKING THE COVID-19 VACCINE: I just need more time. I need more research to come out and I have my reservations about fertility. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Jacobson says the restaurant, Red Hook Tavern sent out an e-mail requiring all staff to get vaccinated now that they're eligible in New York. When she pushed back, she says she received an e-mail terminating her employment. QUESTION: Do you think it's fair for a workplace to be able to determine whether or not its employees should be vaccinated? JACOBSON: I don't. CARLSON: You heard what she said, she's not a crazy person. She's not a denier. I'd like more evidence, I'd like more research to come out. She's got questions about the vaccine, a vaccine that was produced faster than any other vaccine in history. But if you have those questions, you can't have a job. Now once again, to be totally clear, we're not talking about they deride as vaccine denial, anti-vaxxer. The woman you just saw it says she supports vaccines. And by the way, most people do support vaccines because they've saved more lives than any other advance in science. But even the good vaccines can have side effects. And it's fair to ask what those side effects might be. Why wouldn't it be fair to ask that? Just days ago, ""The New York Times"" reported that quote: ""A few COVID vaccine recipients developed a rare blood disorder. A link to the vaccines is not certain, and investigations are underway in some reported cases."" Okay. So let's say you wanted to wait for the results of those investigations you read about in ""The New York Times."" Sound fair? No, you can't. Sorry, you lose your job for that. You might lose your right to travel within this country, the one you were born in. In a moment like this, where things are moving so quickly in a dark direction, you've got to wonder, where are all the liberals? Where are our leaders, the people we elect to protect us from irrational and destructive overreach like what we're seeing now? Most people are gone. They've ceded all authority to those who describe themselves as scientists. Joe Biden admitted this out loud in August. Watch. QUESTION: If you're sworn in come January, and we have coronavirus and the flu combining, which many scientists have said is a real possibility, would you be prepared to shut this country down again? JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I would be prepared to do whatever it takes to save lives because we cannot get the country moving until we control the virus. QUESTION: If the scientists say shut it down? BIDEN: I would shut it down. I would listen to the scientists. CARLSON: Now you thought the voters were in charge of the country speaking through their elected leaders. That's why we have elections, but that's not true. The scientists are in charge, I would listen to the scientists. And Biden is not the only one who says this. This is a staple of our public conversation these days. So what are the scientists saying? Well, yesterday, the most scientific of all the scientists, the supremely, science based, Dr. Anthony Fauci, told us we could all be wearing masks in 2022. This was a surprise. You thought the vaccine would make your life -- it could return to normal. No, according to Tony Fauci, you thought wrong, things are never getting back to normal. DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: You and the President have suggested that we'll approach normality toward the end of the year, what does normal mean? Do you think Americans will still be wearing masks, for example, in 2022? DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: You know, I think it is possible that that's the case. And again, it really depends on what you mean by normality. If normality means exactly the way things were before we had this happen to us. I mean, I can't predict that. CARLSON: Oh, I can't predict that, if it means returning to the life you love. So what can Dr. Fauci predict? Well, we don't need masks, he told us. But he said, we do need masks actually, we probably need two masks, maybe three. And in fact, we might need those masks forever. Those are some of Tony Fauci's many predictions. We showed you his greatest hits before on the show. We're not going to wreck your night with it again. But the question is, and we should be thinking about this. What effect will this current suspension of our Bill of Rights have on American society over time? What kind of country will your grandkids live in? Is anyone even asking that question? No, not anymore, because questions are disloyal. If you believe in science, simply obey. Meanwhile, the cost mount -- the real ones, measurable: bankruptcies, addictions, suicides. So what will the country look like when it's over? Well, it could be dirtier for sure, the environment. Here's one unintended consequence of the lockdown regime that absolutely nobody is talking about, the degradation of our natural environment. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Odds are over the past several months of dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, you've seen a mask or two on the ground. The Chattahoochee River keeper, Jason Ulseth says he has never seen the river filled with so much plastic, and we're not just talking about water bottles and food containers. JASON ULSETH, CHATTAHOOCHEE RIVER KEEPER: We've actually pulled over two million pounds of trash out of the river system, and gloves and masks have not been something we've seen in the past. CARLSON: So where all the people who care about nature? All the environmentalist, where are they on that? Well, they're probably hiding somewhere with the free speech people and the pro-choice community, too afraid to speak up. One person who apparently is not afraid to speak up is Naomi Wolf who is undoubtedly losing friends by appearing on this show tonight. She is the author of ""The End of America: Letter of Warning to a Young Patriot"" and the CEO of DailyClout. She joins us tonight. Naomi Wolf, I appreciate your coming on. I never thought I would be talking to you except in a debate format. I'm sure we disagree on an awful lot. But on this, I was struck by the bravery it must have taken you to write it. I'm sure you lost friends over it, for doing this, tell us why you're doing this and why you wrote that? NAOMI WOLF, CEO, DAILYCLOUT: Well, it's not just think -- first of all, thank you, Tucker, I'm really happy to be talking to you. It's not just that one tweet, I've been writing pretty much every day for months and months about what I see as the terrible crisis that we're in that we have to recognize, under the guise of a real medical pandemic, we're really moving into a coup situation, a police state situation and that's not a partisan thing that you know, as you say, that transcends everything you and I might agree or disagree on and that should bring together left and right to protect our Constitution. We're absolutely moving into what I call Step 10. I wrote a book in which I pointed out there were 10 steps that would be tyrants always take when they want to close down a democracy. Whether they're on the left or the right, they always do the same 10 things and now we're at something I never thought I'd see in my lifetime. You described it really, really well. It is Step 10. And that's the suspension of the rule of law. That's when you start to be a police state and we're here. There's no way around it. CARLSON: I'm so embarrassed, and it's just -- it's another example, there are a million of them of why partisanship is stupid, and it makes you stupid. And I guess I just assumed that we wouldn't agree on stuff, so I didn't read your tweets, and I obviously should have been and I missed a lot. And so again, it's nice to remember, you should treat people as individuals rather than as standards for whole political parties. You have been predicting this for a long time, you just said. Why don't you think others aren't seeing this? WOLF: Well, unfortunately, a lot of people are seeing it, but we are not unified, and as you pointed out, we're a very divided country for a lot of cynical reasons. CARLSON: Yes. WOLF: I'm in touch with many patriots from all backgrounds and all walks of life, who are horrified. I interviewed, for instance, Moms for Liberty, a group of conservative moms in Florida who are mobilizing to try to get schools open. They're so worried about what's happening to their kids. And I talked to a mom, Jen Sey, a famous gymnast and activist in San Francisco on the left, who is also a mom, who is horrified. You know, I've interviewed doctors, I've interviewed, you know, ordinary people, restaurant owners from all walks of life, who are absolutely unable to even articulate their fear and horror, recognizing that the State has now crushed businesses, kept us from gathering in free assembly to worship, as the First Amendment provides, is invading our bodies, as you mentioned, which is a violation of the Fourth Amendment, is restricting movement, fining us here in New York State, I could be fined $15,000.00 a day, if I gather people, you know, more than 10 or 25 people, depending on where in New York State I live. You know, which is a complete violation of the First Amendment, I mean, the violations go on, and on and on. I've talked to restaurant owners who are looking at a sector in which tens of thousands of small businesses have been crushed, and why were they crushed? Not because the pandemic forced them to, there is no real science underlying a lot of these closures. It's because autocratic tyrants at the State and now the national level, are creating a kind of merger of corporate power and government power, which is really characteristic of Italian fascism in the 20s. And they are using that to engage in kind of emergency orders that simply strip us of our rights: rights to property, rights to assembly, rights to worship, and all of the rights that our Constitution guarantees. So people are definitely horrified and noticing, I think people are shocked and divided, as I mentioned before, and the other thing that happened, as you said, this is all been very sudden. And when you look back, you know, March of 2020, a lot of things started to move that kind of locked into place a set of policies that are kind of 360- degree full on totalitarian policies. So I think a lot of us are kind of in culture shock. Luckily, or unluckily, I've been studying closing democracies for 12 years. So I recognized early on, you know, once I realized New York State had emergency powers, I know from history that no one gives up emergency powers willingly. CARLSON: That's right. WOLF: They always drag it on and drag it on. And so every month I'm getting in my e-mail an announcement that Governor Cuomo is extending emergency measures, extending emergency measures. Only from studying history, do I know how predictable it is, when you start to have elected officials say we are not going to follow the Constitution because there's a pandemic. And I just want to say, lastly, and then I promise it'll stop. Nowhere in the Constitution does it say, all this can be suspended if there is a bad disease. We have lived through typhus, cholera, smallpox, HIV, tuberculosis, polio, the Spanish flu. You know, we've lived through an attack on our soil. Never have there been months and months and months of emergency powers when we weren't actually fighting a war. CARLSON: That's right. WOLF: So this is completely unprecedented. Lockdowns have never been done before in free societies. And really, we are turning into a version of totalitarian states before everyone's eyes. And I really hope, you know, we wake up quickly, because history also shows that it's a small window in which people can fight back before it's too dangerous to fight back. CARLSON: Man, I'm starting to think that we're being divided as a country precisely so we don't have conversations like this. And I hope you will come back. Naomi Wolf, what a pleasure. When an eye opening pleasure it was to talk to you tonight. Thank you. WOLF: Thank you, Tucker. Likewise, thank you. CARLSON: In the name of inclusivity, because everything is irony, some of this country's biggest corporations are now teaching employees that they need to be ashamed of how they were born. Who's behind this? We looked into it, that's straight ahead. But first, the team behind the show is launching new programming soon on FOX nation. We will have a new video podcast plus a new documentary series. Here's a trailer. CARLSON: I cannot believe I'm shooting on the Hickok 45 range. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They're stealing what we have here in Maine. They're totally full of [bleep]. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let's go beat Donald Trump. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: My concern in my safety and my daughter's. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We will pass that, they know that. CARLSON: This corridor is more than an energy project, it is an attack of the weak against the strong. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're just so delighted you're a gun guy. CARLSON: Seattle's political leadership voted to defund the police last year. What are they doing with all the money? Well, they put some of it into a new initiative to degrade and destroy their own people. The city is now funding a homeless shelter that's passing out heroin pipes and distributing so-called booty bumping kits so that junkies can inject drugs rectally, for real. Seattle's Human Services Department says the program, quote: ""Reflects the varying needs of those experiencing homelessness in Seattle."" Jason Rantz is a Seattle radio host. He has been documenting the destruction of his city. He joins us tonight. Jason, thanks so much for coming on. If you really hated the people you were in charge of, it seems to me you'd do things like this? JASON RANTZ, SEATTLE RADIO SHOW HOST: Yes, I mean, when you teach addicts who are already the hardest to get off the street a more efficient way to get high in a way that lasts longer. When you're doing it with the so- called booty bumping kits, all you're doing is making it that much easier for them to stay addicted. We have an organization, the Downtown Emergency Services Center that should be helping these people, and they say this is all part of a harm reduction model. That it's about being where the addict is, and making sure that since they're going to engage in this behavior anyway, at least they're doing it safer. But at the end of the day, the results speak for themselves and homelessness and addiction is getting worse in Seattle. In King County, we just had a stunning increase and that's in the language of the very people doing the study of an increase in fentanyl overdoses, meth overdoses going through the roof. Every step of the way, we are seeing the results worsening, not getting better. So maybe harm reduction is literally doing the opposite. CARLSON: Well, maybe it's intentional. I mean, if you did this to your kids, people would say, well, you obviously hate your kids. You're making it easier for them to do heroin. A lot of people die -- I mean, that degrades them. It will kill them, ultimately. Why isn't it very clear to us? They wouldn't do this to a population they loved or cared about? RANTZ: Well, because we've sort of leapt into this PC culture, they'll say that they don't want to stigmatize anybody who is experiencing this and you and I have had this conversation before. I don't want to stigmatize people. I don't want to shame people who are sick and they need help. But I do want to stigmatize the act of shooting up or smoking heroin. We should not be glorifying it. We should not be making it sound like it's exciting to give another aspect of drug addiction a try. We should be making sure that everybody understands that this is unacceptable. It's not okay to do this in a park. It's not okay to do this in an alleyway. And it's certainly not okay to do it in a city-backed center for homeless, especially not okay to do it with city funds. CARLSON: The funny thing is, if they were passing out Marlboros to the homeless, people would freak out. Those are bad for you. But not heroin, it is totally -- it's a really diseased mind, I would say, responsible for this. Jason, it is great to see you. Thank you. RANTZ: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: So you're not really allowed to notice what's happening in Seattle or any of our big cities which are collapsing, and people like Robin DiAngelo are charged with making you not notice. According to Robin DiAngelo, America's biggest problem has nothing to do with economics. It's not crime or unemployment. It's not the mismanagement of the people in charge. The problem with Americans is their DNA. Now, a sane society would reject that for what it is, open racism, but Robin DiAngelo has gotten richer and more famous. She's all over television saying the same thing. Your skin color determines whether or not you're a good person. ROBIN DIANGELO, AUTHOR, ""WHITE FRAGILITY"": I'll never forget asking a group, okay, so what if you could just give us feedback on our inevitable and often unaware racist assumptions and behaviors and I'll never forget this black man raising his hand and saying it would be revolutionary. And you know, just like -- just take that in. I just want all the white people to just take that in. Revolutionary that we would receive the feedback with grace, reflect and seek to change our behavior. That's how difficult we are. That's how big a-holes we are. JIMMY FALLON, TALK SHOW HOST: Yes. CARLSON: Poor Jimmy Fallon. He just wanted to sing songs and do his little comedy thing and yet, he got caught up in this horrible moment and he is going along with it. It is a hostage tape every night. That was last year, by the way, Robin DiAngelo has not gone away. Now, she is delivering video lectures as part of something called ""The LinkedIn Learning Series."" And if LinkedIn is behind it, it's everywhere. Several major corporations direct employees to the learning platform, which is owned by Microsoft. In wonderful lunatic presentations, DiAngelo notes that quote, ""To be less white is to be less oppressive, less arrogant, less defensive, and more humble."" You're seeing that slide on your screen. The presentation goes on to urge employees to quote, ""Try to be less white."" Again, many corporations are using LinkedIn for training including Coca-Cola, which is run, you won't be surprised to know, by a white guy. J.D. Vance is the author of ""Hillbilly Elegy."" He joins us tonight. J.D., I have to wonder what effect this kind of stuff is having on our society. J.D. VANCE, AUTHOR, ""HILLBILLY ELEGY"": Well, first of all, Tucker, I think it's ridiculous and frankly, it's destroying our society. So you I think about my own family, Tucker, one of the great things that's happened to me, I think the greatest thing in my life is that I married a woman who wasn't the same skin color as me and I was able to do that, because I grew up in a country that taught us not to think about each other as members of a racial group. We were taught to think about each other as people. And what these people are doing by constantly forcing us to focus on the color of our skin is they are destroying an essential part of American heritage that we can judge people based on the content of their character. They're doing it, I think, for cynical reasons, but at the end of the day, they're going to destroy something that's critical and important and good about this country and we should fight back against it. CARLSON: I wonder how you can you live in -- I mean, we have, cynicism aside, a truly diverse country. There is no majority religion, even barely ethnicity at this point. That's -- I don't think anyone's mad about that. But how do you have a country like that if you're taught by your leaders to hate each other because of your differences? Like how does that work long term? VANCE: Well, at the end of the day, it doesn't work, Tucker. And I think one of the big things that's happening in our country right now is that we're constantly divided against each other, because that's the way our leaders want it. And it's important to ask what's going on? Why is this happening? And if you look behind identity politics, it's almost always about power. What happens to you if you don't participate in these woke trainings? What happens to you if you don't echo the party line? Well, two things happen to you. First of all, you're more precarious at your job. It's easier to fire you if you don't go along with the woke H.R. Department. The second thing that happens is you're deprived of your core freedom of speech. So the two things that are core fundamental values and rights in this country, the right to provide for your family, the right to participate in the self-government of this country are both taken away from you if you don't -- if you don't tow the woke party line. CARLSON: That's right. This can't be legal. It's happening everywhere. At some point, people are going to start to file class action suits, and we'll support them when they do. In the meantime, J.D. Vance, great to see you. Thank you so much. VANCE: Thank you. CARLSON: So murder rates in almost every city in America, maybe every city, we haven't checked all of them, but in the big ones, they are way, way, way up. Crime is way up. It's out of control. At that exact moment, Congress is trying to tell you, you don't have a right to defend yourself. They're trying to take your guns away. It's not a legal right. We have a very specific segment coming up on what exactly they are planning for your self-defense. That's next. CARLSON: Well, you may not have known this, but we're here to tell you that Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee of Houston is in fact a firearms expert, a kind of Rain Man of rifles. She is the kind of gun nut who can hold an AR-15, America's rifle and tell you exactly how much it weighs. In September of 2019, she did precisely that. REP. SHEILA JACKSON LEE (D-TX): My bill that I've introduced dealing with a caliber weapon. I've held an AR-15 in my hand, I wish I had it. It is as heavy as 10 boxes that you might be moving and the bullet that is utilized, a 50-caliber, these kinds of bullets need to be licensed and do not need to be on the streets. CARLSON: The bullet that is utilized, the 50-caliber, the AR-15, I mean, it's like so embarrassing. How can someone like that serve in Congress? Why is she in charge of your life? Great question. Sheila Jackson Lee has authored a new bill based on her deep firearm knowledge, the AR-15 that shoots the 50-cal. It would set a bunch of restrictions up that have no precedent in American history. Minimum gun ownership, age of 21, extensive licensing and psychological evaluations for all gun owners, a firearms registry for every gun sold, even ones you give to your kids for Christmas and a ban on certain kinds of ammo. We don't know which ones yet. Maybe the 50-cal. Jesse Kelly is the host of ""The Jesse Kelly Show."" He joins us tonight to assess. I know you've got an AR at home that shoots a 50-cal. Tell us what this bill would -- I am not making fun of it, it is actually not funny that a crazy person who knows nothing could have the ability to write legislation. What does this bill seek to do, do you think? JESSE KELLY, HOST, ""THE JESSE KELLY SHOW"": Well, what it seeks to do is bring control under the A.G., Tucker. If you dig into the bill at all, it gives that licensing you talked about, it gives control of that jurisdiction of that under the A.G. and the A.T.F. I don't know if we could go a worse route in this country than giving control of who owns a weapon to the A.G. and A.T.F. Everybody should remember we just had Eric Holder, we're about to have another nut ball I'm sure. Do you think the people who have called you and I Nazis for the last four years are going to determine that you and I should be allowed to open firearms? I don't think so. CARLSON: It's just so -- it's such a smart point and it is just so interesting if you look at the death toll over the past nine months of American citizens killed by gunfire, almost nobody who pulled the trigger in any of those thousands of killings was a legal gun owner. So why are they focusing on legal guns owners? JESSE KELLY: We know why, Tucker. The same reason all the Antifa-Black Lives Matter animals stayed to the cities when they were burning down cities this summer. They didn't go out to the suburbs for a reason. They want you and I disarmed so their left-wing street radical groups can come abuse us at will. I know you've personally experienced this. That's the only reason they want to do this. And when they're done doing this, they'll have their corporate partners go after things like ammo. They're going to go after all the things that you and I need. And look, a weapon without ammo doesn't do me any good. It's like handing Sheila Jackson Lee a book. CARLSON: No, that's -- I think it's a totally fair point. Why do the rest of us play along? There will be some tragic mass shooting because they are a feature of American life that'll be used as the pretext to strip you of your right to defend yourself, and a lot of Republicans will be like, oh, we need to do something. Why do we keep falling for the same lie? JESSE KELLY: Because Republicans don't have any spine. Republicans will arrive at the exact right issue, right spot on an issue as soon as it's too late for them to do anything about it. So they constantly give ground. You notice, we never take ground, Tucker. When was the last G.O.P. bill, major bill that passed through Congress that increased your and my firearms rights? I wasn't alive for that moment. I'm not so sure George Washington was alive for that moment. So I wouldn't bank on the G.O.P. guarding you. CARLSON: Very smart point. Jesse, great to see you tonight. Thank you. JESSE KELLY: See you, Tucker. CARLSON: So the economy collapse in 2008 nobody saw it coming, but actually a couple of people did. And one of them, the person who saw it most clearly is very concerned about the current state of our economy. We'll tell you why. CARLSON: Nobody knows anything. That's the point we often make on the show, but it's not totally true. A few people know a lot. Michael Burry knows a lot. He is one of the smartest people in American Finance. Who is Michael Burry? Well, he was one of the very few Americans who understood that the housing bubble of the late 2000s would lead to system- wide destruction of our economy, which of course, in the end it did. How did Michael Burry manage to see that coming? Well, unlike most investors, he is also a physician. He is trained to assess problems empirically on the basis of evidence rather than theory. If you're interested in the details of what Burry was saying in 2007 and 2008, read or watch ""The Big Short,"" which is based largely on his predictions of the last financial crash. So with that in mind, what is Michael Burry saying about the economy now? Well, among other things, Burry is highly concerned about something called Modern Monetary Theory -- MMT. MMT is essentially the belief that big governments like ours can pay for everything indefinitely simply by printing more money. Now, that's an old idea, but there's a problem with it. Printing more money causes inflation, inevitably, no one denies that. It's always true. What makes MMT new and alluring is that its theorist claim to have a solution to that problem, radically increase taxes. Less cash in the system would mean less inflation. If people don't have income to spend, prices can't go up as quickly. When you have no money, you can't overpay for goods and services. No inflation. Does that sound appealing to you? To a certain kind of socialist academic, it all makes perfect sense. What does the public think of this plan? Well, no one has asked them because nobody cares. But Michael Burry thinks the rest of us should be prepared for the consequences of this, quote: ""The U.S. government is inviting inflation with its MMT-tinged policies."" Burry wrote over the weekend in a series of tweets. Burry went on to quote extensively from a 1974 book called ""Dying of Money,"" which explains what Germany looked like a hundred years ago right before hyperinflation there changed that country and the rest of the world forever. As it collapsed, the German economy took on, quote: "" ... unmistakable characteristics. One was the great wealth, at least of those favored by the boom. Many great fortunes sprang up overnight. The cities had an aimless and wanton youth. Prices in Germany were steady and both business and the stock market were booming. The exchange rate of the mark against the dollar and other currencies actually rose for a time, and the mark was momentarily the strongest currency in the world."" ""Side by side with the wealth where pockets of poverty. Greater numbers of people remained on the outside of the easy money looking in, but not able to enter. The crime rates soared. Accounts of the time tell of a progressive demoralization, which crept over the common people, compounded of their weariness with a breakneck pace to no visible purpose, and their fears from watching their own precarious position slip, while others grew so conspicuously rich."" ""Speculation alone, while adding nothing to Germany's wealth, became one of its largest activities. The fever to join in turning a quick mark infected nearly all classes. Everyone from the elevator operator up was playing the market,"" End quote. And then inevitably, of course, it all collapsed, quote, ""The Deutsche marks that existed in the world in the summer of 1922, all of them were not worth enough by November of 1923 to buy a single newspaper or a tram ticket. That was the spectacular part of the collapse. But most of the real loss in money wealth had been suffered much earlier."" End quote. A book worth getting. Does it sound familiar? Don't think about it, assures the Biden administration. We've got a female Treasury Secretary, the critical diversity component of American economic policy has been covered. Rest assured. But Michael Burry isn't resting assured and he is not convinced. Yesterday, he sent this tweet: ""People say I didn't warn last time. I did, but no one listened. So I warn this time, and still no one listens. But I will have proof I warned."" You've heard a lot about an armed insurrection that took place in Washington on January 6th. Was it armed? No one has really looked at that. Our next guest has looked at every arrest that day and has the answer. That's next. MERRICK GARLAND, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL NOMINEE: I supervised the prosecution of the perpetrators of the bombing of the Oklahoma City Federal Building, who sought to spark a revolution that would topple the Federal government. If confirmed, I will supervise the prosecution of white supremacists and others who stormed the Capitol on January 6th, a heinous attack that sought to disrupt a cornerstone of our democracy, the peaceful transfer of power to a newly elected government. CARLSON: That was Merrick Garland today at his confirmation hearing to be Joe Biden's next Attorney General. Merrick Garland has a lot of reasonable friends who say he is a smart and moderate person, but that was not a moderate statement. It was dishonest, completely dishonest. Dishonest enough, you should be worried about it. There is no evidence that white supremacists are responsible for what happened on January 6th, that's a lie. And contrary to what you've been hearing, there is also no evidence that this was a quote, ""armed insurrection."" Now, nobody has really gone through the arrests to reach that conclusion firmly until Julie Kelly did. She writes for ""American Greatness."" She's got a new piece on this topic, which we recommend. She joins us tonight. Julie, thanks so much for coming on. I'm glad that you actually did the work that maybe ""The New York Times"" could have done, where you looked at the people who were arrested to assess the claim, was this an armed insurrection? What did you find? JULIE KELLY, SENIOR CONTRIBUTOR ""AMERICAN GREATNESS"": So Tucker, I know that you will be shocked to learn that the armed insurrection trope that we've been hearing for the past six weeks is not true. Of the more than 200 people arrested so far, mostly with misdemeanors, trespassing and disorderly conduct charges, only 14 people have been charged with any type of weapons violation. Only a handful of those people actually used any kind of weapon, pepper spray, a helmet, a riot shield against an officer or against the building, actually, not to downplay what they did. But Tucker only two people have been charged with any kind of firearms violation. Now, when most people hear armed insurrection, they think of guns and ammunition and firearms. Only two people face charges, mostly for violating D.C.'s very strict gun control laws. It had nothing to do with the Capitol. They don't even have proof that they were inside the building at any point. CARLSON: Right. So your piece, which again, I hope that our viewers read, because it's really smart, repeatedly makes the point what the rioters did on January 6th was wrong. You don't approve of it at all. JULIE KELLY: Right. CARLSON: You disapprove of it. But the lying about it is so relentless and coordinated. And very -- they are white supremacists. They were armed when they -- there's no evidence they are white supremacists, and they weren't - - no one used a gun inside the Capitol. The only firing that took place was from police and an unarmed protester. So like, why are they lying like this about it? JULIE KELLY: Well, because they continue to get away with it, Tucker. I mean, from Russian collusion, you go through all of the lies that the left and the Democrats and a lot of Republicans, too, have said over the past five years in an effort to damage Donald Trump, sabotage him. But look, it's really alarming what the Justice Department is doing, and for Merrick Garland today to repeatedly say that he is going to put yet another political partisan prosecution at the top of his priority list, overtaking the serious public safety concerns that most Americans have, a lot of his comments today were very alarming. This is another use of our Justice Department weaponized against political foes of the Beltway, but now they're targeting average Americans holding them without bail in jail, and bankrupting people for -- really for misdemeanors. CARLSON: Yes, this is not equal application of law. JULIE KELLY: No. CARLSON: And it's scary for that reason. I appreciate you coming on tonight, Julie. Thank you. JULIE KELLY: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: We'll be back tomorrow night, 8:00 p.m. and every week night. The show this the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. Stay cheerful in spite of it, or at least try. The Great Sean Hannity, up next from New York. Classification"
2021-02-01,"TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. Happy Monday. The news is moving with bewildering speed, in case you haven't noticed. We've noticed. No presidential administration has ever changed so many basic institutions and facts of American life, and done it so quickly. We've done our best to bring you nightly updates on what's happening for the week and a half that Joe Biden has been President, but at times, it's overwhelming, there's just too much to cover. The other day, for example, we learned that the Biden administration plans to make the tiny District of Columbia, our 51st state, a more corrupt English speaking version of Monaco, as if lobbyists in Washington didn't have enough control over your life. Now, there will be U.S. senators. But that's not even the biggest news. Just a few hours ago, Biden officials informed us that after almost 65 years of working to build a nuclear weapon, the nation of Iran maybe finally -- and you'll find this amazing, quote: ""just weeks away"" from getting a bomb. After 65 years of trying. What a coincidence. You already know how that story is going to end, another pointless foreign war, trillions spent many dead, the United States gaining nothing. We've seen that a lot and it's happening again. Joe Biden just sent American troops to Syria. Well, you didn't know that? Yes. Hours after he became President, American soldiers crossed into the nation of Syria, sending them to Syria was one of the first things Joe Biden did. Somehow most of the media forgot to even mention that. In their defense, as noted, there's a lot going on in the news, including a lot of troop mobilization. Syria is not the only place they're massing. Washington, D.C. looks like occupied Sarajevo tonight, a small city overflowing with soldiers. The troops came last month, tens of thousands of them. We were told they're going to protect the capital from the inevitable right-wing violence, certainly certain to accompany Joe Biden's Inauguration. Then Joe Biden was inaugurated, and there wasn't any violence. Donald Trump didn't chain himself to the North Portico. Trump voters didn't rush the stage. The Trump restoration never happened. And yet, the troops stayed. No one in Congress seemed to notice, but in fact, they're still arriving, as of tonight, thousands of them. As of last Thursday, National Guard troops from 23 states were stationed in Washington. That number seems to have risen over the past few days. We called the National Guard today to find out by how much, but they couldn't give us numbers or wouldn't. We do know that more states have sent troops since last week. You may have seen the video of soldiers getting off buses downtown near the Capitol. What are they all doing there? Again, National Guard leadership wouldn't tell us quote, ""for operational security reasons,"" the spokesman said, ""We will not get into specific details of the ongoing mission."" Oh, soldiers in our capital, but we don't have a right to know. Got it. JB Pritzker, who is the Governor of Illinois was not so shy about the purpose. He laid it out very clearly. In a press release announcing the deployment of more soldiers to Washington, D.C., Pritzker explained that, quote, ""We must root out the dark forces of racism, white supremacy and disinformation that have created this moment."" Let that sink in. The military has been deployed to Washington, D.C. to fight disinformation. So say something a Democratic Governor doesn't like and he will send troops. Does that sound like the country that you grew up in? It probably doesn't. This is not the way things are done in America. It's not the way they have been done since the Civil War. No one alive has ever seen anything like this. So why is everyone -- everyone pretending it's totally normal to have thousands of troops in the Capitol to fight disinformation? Because obviously, they're in favor of it. They think it is fine to mobilize the Army in order to put down domestic opinions. MSNBC though, let us remind you, an opinion channel, is completely in favor of this. Watch. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And now, nearly 5,000 National Guard troops will be deployed in D.C. through March as some congressional staffers and extremism researchers say there are concerns about possible violence surrounding the upcoming impeachment proceedings. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The National Guard will have to stay there as a symbol to those people who think that that building is vulnerable, and that includes the American citizens who went up there and performed insurrection. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Inside The Pentagon's decision to keep thousands of National Guard troops in the streets of Washington, D.C. as we get a new gut punch from the F.B.I. affirming the greatest threat facing the American people is already among us. CARLSON: Oh extremism researchers. So the Southern Poverty Law Center is now in charge of the Pentagon. You should know that. The whole thing is a gut punch, by the way, they just told you. Gut punch? Not to the people in charge who have ordered up an unspecified number of soldiers for an unspecified number of soldiers for an unspecified period of time for purposes they refuse to explain to us. No, that's not a gut punch. It's not a big deal. It is business as usual here in Kurdistan. The gut punch is, the fact is, it definitely is a fact, it is not at all terrifying Rwanda level propaganda. The fact is that, quote, ""The greatest threat facing the American people is already among us."" Already among us. They're here. Terrified yet? The woman that you just saw on television went to Harvard, incidentally, so you can believe it when she tells you what the real threat is. It's not like she was reading from a ministry of truth press release issued by some creepy authoritarian regime. No, not at all. She knows who the enemy is. And this week, the enemy was a freshman Congresswoman from the 14th District of Florida. No one is more scary. No threat is more imminent or dangerous tonight to this nation, ladies and gentlemen, than this freshman Member of Congress. The threat that she alone poses, as they say in cable news, it existential. Indeed, this single Congresswoman maybe just weeks away from developing nuclear weapons. If you watched television this weekend, you already know quite a bit about her. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Trump has also been in touch with Florida Congresswoman and noted QAnon devotee, Marjorie Taylor Greene. PAMELA BROWN, CNN HOST: Marjorie Taylor Greene has spent the weekend scrubbing her social media accounts. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: People who are spreading conspiracy theories and doubling down on inciting violence. That, of course, is Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene. ABBY PHILLIP, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: You know, Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has been in the news this whole weekend is a conspiracy theorist. BRIAN STELTER, CNN CHIEF MEDIA CORRESPONDENT: Certainly, news outlets have been exposing Representative Greene's history of hate. But is the coverage also building her up? CARLSON: Oh, so how dangerous -- just how dangerous is this three-named Congresswoman, you probably have never heard of? Well, so dangerous, that in the name of democracy, she must be expelled tonight from the Congress. That's what they're saying. No one is claiming voter fraud here. The member in question was elected just months ago with 75 percent of the vote. Now, that's roughly the same percentage of the vote that Nancy Pelosi got out in San Francisco. So there's no question that her voters very much wanted her to represent them in Washington. On the other hand, what do her voters have to do with democracy? That's not how democracy works. In the new democracy, CNN gets the veto. If cable news doesn't like your views, you have to leave Congress. That's the rule. The test is entirely ideological. You don't actually have to harm anyone to lose your job. This new Member of Congress has barely even voted. She just got there the other day. But CNN says she has bad opinions, therefore, she is the greatest threat we face. Now, if you're skeptical about any of this, our advice is keep it to yourself because free inquiry is dead. Unauthorized questions are hate speech. Anyone who suggests that this one Member of Congress is not really America's greatest enemy is by definition, one of America's greatest enemies, and that would definitely include this show, which CNN spent yet another weekend trying to get pulled off the air by force. Censoring a news program is not censorship when the people at CNN don't agree with what that program says. Okay. They actually said that. They are children obviously, but that does not mean they will not win in the end, or that it won't get worse in the meantime. Why? Simple. Donald Trump is gone now. That's very bad news for the many people who made a living yelling at Donald Trump, and it is especially dangerous for their political party. A party whose nonsensical coalition can only hang together by collectively throwing rocks at whomever happens to be at the center of the hate circle today. So there's no more Donald Trump. That means you get to be Donald Trump now. See how that feels. It's all pretty predictable, you could have written this script. The sad thing is, they are missing a lot. This is the media after all, their job is to cover the news, and there are tons of interesting things happening right now. Things that you tend to miss when you spend all day screaming about a single Member of Congress from Georgia. For example, there's the populist revolt underway on Wall Street. That's not a small story. It's still going on tonight. In fact, it is spreading. What began as attack on short sellers will likely change our economy permanently and forever. So why are the Reddit guys doing this in the first place? It would be nice if someone somewhere had asked that question. Is it possible that the Reddit guys have a point, however destructive their tactics may turn out to be? Could it be that COVID has so dramatically accelerated the concentration of wealth in this country to a degree that's dangerous and completely unsustainable, that this was a reaction to it? But because corporations have made it impossible for people to say anything that's true out loud anymore? Simple things like, hey, hedge funds aren't actually very good for the country, or, whoa, why don't we still have something as obviously corrupt as the carried interest loophole in our tax code, things like that? Because you can't say any of that in public without being called a racist by some goon from the H.R. department down the hall, the Reddit guys maybe had nowhere else to express their justifiable frustration and instead took it out on our public markets. Could that have happened? Just spit-balling. Totally possible that's what's going on here. But that segment was not on cable news this weekend, nor was any speculation about how long a market that is this disconnected from reality can continue. How long before the whole thing crashes, not just the stock market, but any society built on mandatory lying? How long before Davos man, the flimsiest emblem ever created of our new age evaporate like meringue in the rain, and we return to the real things? Physics, gravity, reason, God. How long? Anytime? Those are all good questions. None have been addressed lately in the media. Instead, we saw ""Newsweek"" fret about the quote, ""far right extremists who may be using Reddit to mock our noble hedge funds."" ""The Washington Post"" meanwhile, saw the resemblance -- not unreasonable, if we're being honest here -- between what's happening on Wall Street right now and what happened in the 2016 presidential election. They were appalled, of course. When the hedge funds take a hit, it's mob rule. Even the corporate comedians weighed in, bowing before their masters in finance. Watch this guy tell you that it must have been the Russians doing this. No decent, loyal American would hurt a hedge fund, and for once he is not joking. JIMMY KIMMEL, TALK SHOW HOST: Over the past six months, their stock price has grown by 8,000 percent because a bunch of amateur investors, maybe even some Russian disruptors who are part of a Reddit community called WallStreetBets, decided to buy a bunch of GameStop stock and drive the price up and screw over the hedge fund guys. CARLSON: Yes, if you're screwing over the hedge funds, you must be Russian because there are no underlying problems that American citizens might be reacting against, none. What is going on here exactly? Here to tell us, a man whose name has become a synonym for Wall Street's recklessness and corruption, but someone who has actually learned from his experiences, and has interesting things to say about the moment we're in right now. He is Jordan Belfort, the original Wolf of Wall Street. We're happy to have him on tonight. Jordan, thanks so much for coming on the show. JORDAN BELFORT, AUTHOR, ""WOLF OF WALL STREET"": My pleasure. CARLSON: So, you've participated in this from every possible angle. You've watched it for decades, what do you think is going on here with the Reddit guys? BELFORT: Well, I think you hit it right on the head, and that was my thesis for tonight. It was: this is really a convergence of a few different things. Number one, finally, the little guy has the ability to fight back through a convergence of technology, the platforms for trading, the ability to communicate as a group. CARLSON: Yes. BELFORT: So in the past, you could have never have done this before. So there are two types of short sells in this world. There's legitimate ones, that's a natural part of the market, and there's another part that are these hedge funds that gang up and literally will short a stock almost down to zero, out of business. They try to spread negative news, they'll start investigations. And that's what started with GameStop, massively over shorting the stock, and this I think, as you said, connects to a far bigger thing than just trying to make a few bucks on a trade. This is about the end of the movie, ""The Big Short"" where like it said all the bad guys went to jail. Ha-ha. Just kidding. No. No one went to jail. CARLSON: Exactly. BELFORT: So I think everyone knows there is something really wrong in the pit of their stomach. You can silence people, you can de-platform people. You can, you know, break things with BleachBit and hammers and get away with it. Everyone knows whether you're on the Republican or Democrat, there's something wrong. CARLSON: That's right. CARLSON: That's why both sides of the aisle united on this one thing. You notice that. Both sides united because it was money sort of takes the politics out of it. So what happened here is these people, like if you actually dig into the boards, like I did, because my first reaction was, it was a pump and dump. But no, it's really not what's going on. If you actually look at the messages, these people are mad. They have something they want to prove. It's not really about money, they want to make some money here, but they are angry as hell and they're sick and tired of getting stomped out by Wall Street, which they have been forever, and they finally now have at least some ammunition to get back. The danger is, it is going to end badly for the stocks, and I hope people you know, don't lose money in the process. CARLSON: I wonder though, I mean, now that this has happened, everybody knows it has happened and that the hedge funds and Wall Street are more vulnerable maybe than anyone imagined and the internet still exists. I mean, what does this portend going forward? How -- I mean, we can't continue as we have, can we? BELFORT: Sure. So one thing Wall Street and hedge funds are very good at is closing gaps and finding these sort of inefficiencies and closing them up. So what these people on Reddit -- I mean, my hat's off to them, by the way, it was brilliant what they did is they found a real inefficiency in the market and a gap where something had been dramatically over-shorted and they could actually, you know, get enough buying power. They did that. Wall Street now knows that. So I would be very shocked if hedge funds would create another situation so quickly where it was so overly shorted that it would be that easy for people to come in as a group and bring the stock back up and start a short squeeze, so that might end. But I believe this is a paradigm shift right now. The little guy finally is equipped, information travels instantly now. It used to be only the big guys: they paid the analysts, they had you know, all this stuff happened before the little guy, the big guys were colluding doing this stuff, right? So now the little guy finally has the ability to play that same game at least somewhat and there's going to be a radical change, it's not going to be the same. CARLSON: So I know you've had an exotic and famously wild personal life that was so much more interesting and insightful than anything I've heard on any other channel about what we're seeing and I'm grateful that you came on tonight. Thank you. Jordan Belfort, good to see you. BELFORT: My pleasure. CARLSON: At some point, someone is going to make the obvious observation, which is income inequality, which is making our country unstable is being driven really from one main source, and that's the Federal Reserve, which is shoveling money to Wall Street excluding most people from that payoff, and hurting a lot of people like savers in the process. Maybe we'll have that conversation at some point, hopefully soon. Well up next, dozens of our elected leaders have just made a major push to add a 51st state, a new star to our flag. That state would be Washington, D.C., which is actually a city not a state. It's unconstitutional. They're aware of that, they're doing it anyway. Who are these 38 members of the Senate? We're going to name them for you because you should know exactly who they are. That's straight ahead. CARLSON: Let's see. Can Washington, D.C. become a state? It's not a state, it is a pretty small city, probably the most dysfunctional city in America. But can we make it a state if we want it to? Well, let's check our Constitution. Oh, there it is. Article I, Section 8. Washington, D.C. is not a state. It can't be, it's a Federal jurisdiction. So that's pretty clear. Anyone who read it would know. But Members of Congress either haven't read it or don't care. They're trying to make D.C. a state anyway, quite a news story. And for that, Rick Leventhal joins us with details. Hey, Rick. RICK LEVENTHAL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Tucker, it's Delaware's Democratic Senator Tom Carper who was leading the effort to pass a D.C. statehood bill along with more than three dozen others who we are showing you here. Carper says it would rectify a historic injustice because the 700,000 residents of the nation's capital endure taxation without representation. The issue of D.C. statehood has been proposed for years, but this would be the first time a bill could actually make it. The 51st State has actually passed the House and moves on to the Senate where there are 38 co-sponsors who you're seeing on your screen. They say D.C. residents pay more in Federal taxes per capita than citizens of any of the 50 states. The residents have no say in how that money is spent. The city's mayor says the momentum in Congress is quote, ""a promising sign that our country is finally ready to right this historic wrong."" And on the plan, D.C. would be renamed Washington Douglass Commonwealth in honor of Frederick Douglass. If we get two senators and one House rep in the area around the White House, the Capitol, the Supreme Court, the National Mall would be a separate Federal District controlled by Congress and named the Capitol. But for all that to happen, Tucker, Senate Democrats will need at least 10 Republicans to support the legislation, which could be very difficult to accomplish. CARLSON: Rick Leventhal, great to see you. Thank you. LEVENTHAL: You, too. Thanks. CARLSON: We need at least 10 senators unless they get rid of the filibuster, which Barack Obama just told us is racist because it's a relic of another age. Okay. Right. That could happen very easily. You should be aware of it, and it's not about empowering anybody, obviously. They run Chicago and Detroit, are those cities empowered? No. It's about power for them. And of course, silencing dissent from you. Speaking of Chicago, Democrats have the same goal and they don't care about the consequences. Twenty one people were shot in that city just this weekend -- 21. The city's mayor, Lori Lightfoot doesn't seem that upset about it. Her priorities are different. She wants to suspend all cooperation with Federal immigration authorities, anyone who disagrees with her, obviously, is a bigot. MAYOR LORI LIGHTFOOT (D), CHICAGO, ILLINOIS: Being an immigrant or a refugee is not a crime. Alderman Napolitano and Alderman Ray Lopez, I just have to say, shame on you. Here to debate, which is at the heart of our democracy is not the same as using racist tropes and xenophobic rhetoric to promote yourself on the backs of others and demonize them. And we dare not be silent when that happens, particularly not when it is coming from the mouths of City Council members. CARLSON: Why is it the dumbest people are always the most self-righteous? We asked the mayor to come on to explain that phenomenon, she wouldn't come. Anthony Napolitano is an alderman of Chicago. You just heard his name from the mayor. He joins us tonight with his side of it. Alderman Napolitano, thank you so much for coming on. So she just called you a racist. Someone who uses quote, ""racist tropes."" What was she talking about? ANTHONY NAPOLITANO, CHICAGO ALDERMAN: You know, she was talking about -- they made an amendment to an ordinance that we had in the City of Chicago that came in in 1985 by the late Harold Washington. And in that ordinance, now, it had a certain amount of stipulation set up where our Chicago police officers had the ability to work with Federal governments on behalf of illegal immigrants, especially those that have -- or convicted felons, ones with warrants for arrest, or ones that are named in the gang database. This amendment to the ordinance completely removes that from the ordinance now and pretty much gives a free or the key to the city to any criminal that wants to come here. I didn't agree with her, so that makes me a racist now. CARLSON: So she is undoing the misdeeds of that famous racist black Mayor Harold Washington. She is obviously a Civil Rights hero for doing that. What effect would this have on the City of Chicago, do you think if she gets it through? NAPOLITANO: Well, the effect is going to be catastrophic. I mean, if you look the last 13 months, we've had over 4,300 people shot, over 800 homicides in this month alone -- starting in January alone, we had over 200 carjackings. Now you're inviting people that pretty much have amnesty for any type of criminal prosecution in the City of Chicago to come to Chicago and find a harbor -- a safe haven, I should put it for our protection because our Chicago police officers can help anyone federally now and it's -- this is wrong. And for me to be called a racist because I stood up against this for what's right, I've been a Chicago police officer, a Chicago firefighter and now an alderman for 21 years served proudly, and I get called a racist by someone that's been working for the city not even long enough to finish a cup of coffee is a disgrace. It's disgusting to me. CARLSON: Yes. Someone who is presiding over that many murders is lecturing you. People are fleeing that city, one of the best cities that we have, and they're running away. And this is her response to it. It's just the saddest thing I've seen. NAPOLITANO: I'd like to see the census in about -- do the census a year from now and see what our numbers are. CARLSON: It's shocking, and everyone should be upset about it regardless of party, I think. Anthony Napolitano, I appreciate your coming on tonight. Thank you. NAPOLITANO: Thank you for having me, Tucker. CARLSON: So Joe Biden just in case things aren't out of control enough has just named an NBA cheerleader to a top job to the State Department. But somehow that's not the most amazing part of this story. What she said off the court when she wasn't cheering for the team. It is the most amazing part. We have it for you after the break. CARLSON: As part of our new meet your Joe Biden administration series, I want to introduce you to someone called Jalina Porter, now a top spokesman at the State Department. In that role, Jalina Porter is responsible for communicating American foreign policy to the rest of the world. Now, you may not know much about her job history, but trust us, that's a pretty stunning promotion for her. Before she joined the Biden administration, Jalina Porter was best known as a part-time cheerleader for the Oakland Raiders and the Washington Wizards. She also moonlit for time as a staffer on Capitol Hill, and took the occasional gig as a consultant pushing various strains of identity politics. Of course, those aren't her real qualifications. Jalina Porter's real, quote, ""credential"" like so many in the Biden administration is that she despises millions of Americans and says so. These are the very people she represents overseas. Here's what Jalina Porter wrote on Facebook in September of 2016, and we're quoting, ""The largest threat to U.S. national security, our U.S. cops, not ISIS, not Russian hackers, not anyone or anything else. If you all don't wake up and rise up to this truth, the genocide against blacks in America will continue until we are near extinct."" Those comments by the way, first reported by ""The Washington Free Beacon."" Now it's worth pausing for a moment to consider the implications here because they matter. She is speaking to the United States State Department for our government, for you. In the year 2016, when she wrote that on Facebook, a total of 19 unarmed African-Americans have been shot and killed by police. Twice as many people died by lightning strike in the United States that year. In the last two years, 2019 and 2020, the number of police shootings was even lower than that, lower than 19. But according to a new State Department spokeswoman who now represents the United States government and you, that's genocide. Yes, that's genocide. Not what's happening to Christians in the Middle East, not what is happening to Uighurs in China, not what's happening at the hands of American police officers? Does the Biden administration agree with its own spokesperson on that? Does he even care? Will anyone even respond? The answer, of course is no, no chance. We know that because last month, we told you about Kristen Clarke. She is Joe Biden's nominee to head the Civil Rights Division at the Justice Department. Just to be clear, heading the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department is not like representing the State of Georgia in the 14th Congressional District. It's a job with actual power. We can send people to prison like that. We have a lot of armed people working for you. Kristen Clarke is getting that job and Kristen Clarke once wrote that African-Americans were genetically superior to other races. Now we've said this, we've read the quotes for you which are even worse than we're characterizing and the more shocking. We haven't heard a word from the White House about Kristen Clarke. The Justice Department will not tell us whether her theories of black supremacy have any place in the Civil Rights Division of the D.O.J., the party responsible for enforcing equal rights among all Americans. The truth is, none of this bothers the party in charge. They don't mind if you hate America, if you're a bigot, even if you call for violence as long as they are benefiting from it. And if you don't believe it, recall this clip of Maxine Waters, one of the top Democrats in Congress back in 2018. REP. MAXINE WATERS (D-CA): Now, if you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd and you push back on them and you tell them, they are not welcome. CARLSON: So because there are still geniuses on the internet -- this is such a great story -- an anonymous user on Twitter remembered that moment and decided to conduct a social science experiment. He took Maxine Waters' own words, but he swapped out the phrase Trump Cabinet officials for quote ""Democrats and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's administration,"" here's what he wrote, quote, ""If you see anyone from the Cuomo administration in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, get out and you create a crowd, you push back on them, and you tell them they're not welcome anymore, anywhere."" So how did that go over once it wasn't Maxine Waters who was saying, well, of course, Democrats in New York were apoplectic. ""This is appalling and dangerous,"" barked a Democratic New York State Assemblyman called Carl Heastie. ""Encouraging violence must never be tolerated. Shame on whoever is behind this kind of garbage."" It's unbelievable. New York State Senator Diane Savino said this, ""This is beyond outrageous."" And within a few hours, virtually every Democrat in the State of New York had condemned this anonymous tweet. But the best response came from a congressman called Richie Torres who sits with Maxine Waters on the Financial Services Committee in the House. He said this, quote, ""As a congressman who lived through the insurrection against the U.S. Congress, I am appalled by the tweet below, which is an invitation to violence against public officials. We must all denounce in no uncertain terms any attempt at inciting violence,"" end quote, except attempts committed by Maxine Waters the dangerous insurrectionist I sit next to on the committee, but who I will ignore when she says things that are inconvenient. So according to Maxine Waters, his own a logic, heavy air quotes around that term, Maxine Waters herself is a dangerous insurrectionist white supremacist. I just want to set the record straight on this. Well, the Chinese company BGI Group is one of the largest biotech firms in the world that also has close ties to the Communist Party of China. Now BGI Group is offering to set up coronavirus testing labs in the United States. That sounds like a nice thing. Oh wait, it is part of what Intel officials call a plan to steal Americans' bio data. WILLIAM EVANINA, FORMER DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL COUNTERINTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY CENTER: This shows the nefarious mindset of the Communist Party in trying to take advantage of a worldwide crisis like COVID. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice over): Bill Evanina suspects these lab offers are modern day Trojan horses. BGI comes to the U.S. bearing gifts, but harboring other motives. The labs are a way to establish a foothold to bring their equipment here, start mining your data and set up shop in your neighborhood. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In the last decade or so, you'll see that China has heavily invested through the purchase or acquisition of actual companies, access to our data. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Question is: where is this data going? All roads lead to China. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: China's government understands that their future success hinges on accumulating large amounts of human DNA.  CARLSON: Dr. Marc Siegel here to assess this troubling story. Great to see you, Doctor, would you get tested at one of these labs? DR. MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR: Absolutely not, Tucker. Tucker, here is the secret. The future of medicine has to do with individualized DNA, massive amounts of bio data that will predict our diseases before we even get them. And you know, whoever has that information is going to control healthcare in the world, and China knows that. So BGI Group is the biggest of these companies that works directly with the Chinese government. It took a $1.5 billion amount from the government just in 2010 alone. And last March, while you and I were focusing on Washington State and their poor testing of the new disease, COVID-19, so was BGI Group, Tucker. They went over there. They offered to build a huge lab, do all the testing that was needed. They offered it to New York. They offered it to California. They offered it to five states. And you know what happened? Our own Intelligence Community said, there is no free lunch, but Tucker, that didn't stop BGI Group. They are involved in 60 countries around the world. They're involved in investing heavily in our hospitals and our healthcare sector. You know what they're doing, Tucker? They are mining my DNA, your DNA. They're going to combine it with lifestyle data that's hacked from us and they're going to control healthcare. We have to stop it, Tucker. CARLSON: And you were making me very paranoid and for good reason. I guess, I appreciate it. Dr. Siegel, it is worth knowing. Thank you very much. SIEGEL: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: So Joe Biden has been in office for less than two weeks, it will be two weeks on Wednesday, but already he has eliminated thousands of jobs. Where are they? We will tell you exactly where they are and who has been thrown out of work. That's straight ahead. CARLSON: So the Keystone XL Pipeline was slated to create 11,000 good paying jobs. Now, it will create precisely zero. Joe Biden killed it in his first week in office. But there is some good news and then news comes from John Kerry. He is now the White House's global warming whisperer. He flies around on a private jet to better understand the enemy. John Kerry's message is simple: all the people who are out of work actually have an alternative. They can go build solar panels in China. JOHN KERRY, U.S. SPECIAL PRESIDENTIAL ENVOY FOR CLIMATE: What President Biden wants to do is make sure those folks have better choices, that they have alternatives, that they can be the people who go to work to make the solar panels. They were making them here at home. CARLSON: Salena Zito is a reporter at ""The Washington Examiner"" and a columnist at ""The New York Post."" We're happy to have her on tonight. Salena, thanks so much for coming. There's something about that clip that really -- no matter how you feel about fossil fuels is infuriating. The high handedness with which he dismisses adults -- Americans' jobs. I mean, what do you make of that? SALENA ZITO, REPORTER, ""THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER"": Well, it's incredibly insulting to tell someone they're going to have a better job. What's the description of better? Better paying? I don't think so, solar panel technician jobs are notoriously sometimes three or four times less than what you would make on the Keystone Pipeline, and they are also jobs that will uproot them from their communities and their families. These are aspects that are very important to these workers that they're very -- because they're very connected to their community. CARLSON: I noticed there's sort of a built in bias among our leaders against traditionally masculine jobs and in favor of kind of neutered, sad, Davos-type jobs. I mean, do you see a threat in this at all? ZITO: Well, the problem I see is a problem that people that make these decisions are people that more likely than not haven't worked with their hands, and they don't quite understand the satisfaction of doing that. They don't understand why you would even want to do that. But you know, I would argue, if you're going to impact someone's life, why don't you go to where they live and look them in the eye? Or maybe do what they do and understand why it is important to them, and why it is part of their identity. CARLSON: Right. You've covered the news for a while. How many times have we heard whatever they're taking away is going to be replaced by something better? Didn't they say that NAFTA, trying to join the WTO? We were going to retrain you for something better. How'd that work? ZITO: So what this really reminds me of is what happened in around in my area in Western Pennsylvania, Eastern Ohio, 1977, it was known as Black Monday, where thousands of people lost their job in one day in one industry. But what they didn't take account for was that the barber shops, the hotels, the schools, the school districts, and President Carter, at that time refused to meet with those union workers who went down and asked him to listen to them and help them about their jobs. It's the same thing we're seeing here. CARLSON: What they got was broken families and heroin. It's just so sad. Oh, it's crushing. Salena Zito, I appreciate your coming on tonight. Thank you. ZITO: Thanks for having me. CARLSON: So Mike Rowe has a brand new show digitally. It's called ""Six Degrees with Mike Rowe."" We will be watchers of it. It's sponsored by the energy industry and some people are mad about that. Mike Rowe joins us tonight to tell us about that show. Mike, great to see it. What is this? MIKE ROWE, AUTHOR AND TELEVISION HOST: It's been a very exciting week here, Tucker at Mike Rowe Works world headquarters, where we're embarking upon a new series of work ethic scholarships to help more people get the kind of training they need to do the kinds of jobs that Salena was just discussing, which I don't for the record, believe are dead and gone. I had a show on Facebook, it got canceled a couple of days ago. It started up an incredible rumor mill that I'm trying to deal with, and my new show that you kindly mentioned ""Six Degrees"" is in fact sponsored by API and DCA and all aspects of the energy industry, and I'm now dealing with rumors suggesting that because of that association, the show on Facebook was canceled, and so forth and so on. A very exciting week for me. CARLSON: Is any of that -- what is the truth about it? ROWE: Well, regarding the Facebook show, it was a hit show. It won an Emmy Award. People loved it. It was cancelled after a hundred episodes, and I do not believe it was the result of anything other than the show simply running its course. I'm very concerned, as you know, about cancel culture. I'm very concerned about safe spaces. I don't think anything good comes from those things. But in this case, Facebook was very kind to me, they support my foundation and they let us do a feel good show at a time when the country needed to see it. So I'm grateful for that. The business with the energy industry sponsoring my new show is a different matter altogether. And honestly, watching that last segment, I read Salena's article earlier today, and she says in there, something we hear a lot, she says, elections have consequences. But what they really have are unintended consequences and policies like this drip with unintended consequences. It's not just those 11,000 jobs that went up in smoke, it is people who run hotels and car washes, and so much local business. It's all tied and connected together in a way that's so easy to forget until you start pulling on the string, and you see the whole quilt buckle up and turn into something kind of ugly and worthless. CARLSON: I mean, this is a much longer conversation, but just in a minute. I mean, you've spent your life covering work. You've also seen what it looks like when people don't have work. I mean, how crushing is that for people, particularly men? ROWE: It's not -- it is not just vocational. It's your identity. And these aren't -- you know, I heard somebody say the other day that kind of dismissed all this, as, well, they weren't full-time jobs. Are you kidding me? There's no such thing as a full-time job in construction, first of all. CARLSON: That's right. Exactly right. ROWE: Secondly, I know a lot of these guys. They are making six figures. These are welders and steamfitters and pipe fitters. These are union jobs for the most part. These are the kinds of jobs that people aspire to and they are the kinds of jobs that my foundation has been helping train people for, for the last 13 years and it's hard to sit here and watch it. Honestly, you know, I'm not a political guy. CARLSON: I know. ROWE: But the flick of a pen, and I guess it just comes down to if you really believe the world is going to end in 12 years, you'll do just about anything to keep that from happening, I would. But if you don't believe that, and if you believe that we're all connected through energy as I do, then I think you just have to step back and take a deep breath. CARLSON: If you really believe that you wouldn't be flying private and buying a big place on Martha's Vineyard, I'm just saying. So I don't think anyone really believes that, but maybe they do. I don't know. I'm so glad you have a new show. And I love how fast you're coming out with it. Mike Rowe, we will be watching. Thank you. ROWE: Appreciate it. CARLSON: Well, we learned this weekend that detainees at Guantanamo Bay, including the guy who planned 9/11, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed deserve the coronavirus vaccine more than you do. That's the decision they made. They pulled back a little bit because the rest of us found out about it. But they made that decision. Why did they do that? That's straight ahead. CARLSON: A lot of news out of The Pentagon recently that ought to make you very concerned if you're an American. Most recently, leaders at The Pentagon just got caught pushing a plan to distribute the coronavirus vaccine quote, ""to all detainees and prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba."" That would include 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. He will get the vaccine before millions of Americans get it. Now, The Pentagon was caught doing this, so this weekend, the chief spokesman backed off and said this quote, ""We're pausing the plan to move forward as we review force protection protocols."" Almost beyond belief. Joey Jones is a retired Staff Sergeant. He joins us tonight. Joey, thanks so much for coming on tonight. What do you make of this story? JOEY JONES, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, it's infuriating. I'll tell you what. You give me five minutes with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and I'll make sure he never gets the coronavirus another day in what would be left of his life and I'll sleep well at night knowing that. These are people, they really don't deserve to walk this Earth with us anymore. That's just the truth of it. The fact that they're even breathing air is more grace than they deserve, and the idea that in 2020, you can enlist in the military, serve honorably, get blown to pieces doing it and your government will honor that sacrifice by making military service and identity politics petri dish by restricting your First and Second Amendment. And oh, by the way, prioritizing the terrorists that tried to kill you over you when it comes to getting a vaccine for this virus that we're all dealing with. You know, it's just -- I'm old enough to remember when Representative Cohen from Tennessee was calling white male National Guardsmen insider threats because they voted for Trump. That's where the Democrats are when it comes to that unifying message of support the troops that we've enjoined since 9/11, and God forbid that it really takes something like 9/11 for half the country to support our military. This is -- it's ridiculous. CARLSON: Yes. It's a betrayal. That's exactly -- you're exactly right. That's why -- you must feel it especially acutely. Joey Jones, I appreciate you coming on tonight. Thank you. JONES: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: That's it for us tonight. Again, Happy Monday. We'll be back tomorrow, 8:00 p.m., the show that's the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. In the meantime, Sean Hannity takes over from New York. Classification"
2021-01-20,"TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. Happy Inauguration Day. It's a big moment for the country. The changing of the guard, a peaceful transfer of power, another reassuring display of the awesome pageantry of constitutional government. There were solemn speeches today; sworn oaths, belted anthems, all echoing against the backdrop of 26,000 smartly attired Federal troops who are guarding our capital city from unseen threats. There's quite a display. It was all a lot to take, really. So like many of you, we flipped on the tube to see what it meant. Here's what we learned. JOHN KING, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Joe Biden respects government. He respects people who disagree with him. He listens to them. VAN JONES, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I think that Joe Biden is going to train us to see the world differently. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He plans to usher in a new era of hope, and the action he is promising the minute he takes office. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We've gone from indecency to decency. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He filled that empathy void. JONES: There was not one part of that that wasn't just medicine in the wound. DAVID CHALIAN, CNN POLITICAL DIRECTOR: Those lights that are -- that are just shooting out from the Lincoln Memorial along the reflecting pool, I look -- it's like almost extensions of Joe Biden's arms embracing America. It was a moment where the new President came to town. CARLSON: So to recap, Joe Biden respects people's differences, but at the same time, he is going to train us to be very different from the way we are. He will bring hope and decency. He will fill the yawning void where our empathy should be. He is medicine. Joe Biden's arms lean and hard from decades of empathetic labor on our behalf will encircle us like lights from the Lincoln Memorial. And at that point, well, God knows, anything is possible. If there's a thin bead of sweat forming in your upper lip, as you think about all of this, that's okay. Don't feel shame. Shame isn't necessary now. Joe Biden is here. And not just Joe Biden, Jill Biden, too. Mrs. Biden, Dr. Biden. -- together, the two of them, MSNBC informed us will redeem this nation through their love. Behold. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What a story though. What a great love story between Jill Biden and Joe Biden. It's just a different kind of marriage. This is a love match, like the Obamas were, so I think that'll be healing for the country, too. CARLSON: Biden's marriage is healing for all of us, for the country. The Biden's love is America's love. Jill and Joe are the mother and father of this nation. From their loins, we are born and yet reborn. May their names emerge from our lips in praise forever, and so on. That was cable news today. The funny thing is, and there are many funny things going on right now, every person with a microphone in every TV studio in America today knew the fuller truth when they said things like the ones you just heard. They knew, for example, for certain that Joe Biden isn't well. Everyone in Washington knows that, but no one said it out loud, not a word. They withheld that news from you as they have for months, so much for speaking truth to power. On the other hand, what did you expect? You've watched the lying for years now. You know what it is. You figured out how it works. So it dawned on us today that maybe we ought to stop playing all these stupid media clips every night. It's like watching the town drunk throw up on himself over and over again. Obviously, it's repulsive and shocking. It's hard to turn away. But can you really be surprised by it? Throwing up on themselves is what town drunks do. If you keep watching them as they do it, maybe after a while, you are part of the problem. Maybe so. In any case, we flipped off CNN and decided to check out Joe Biden's speech for ourselves. And it was interesting, actually, both for what it said and for what it didn't say. One particular part of the speech stuck out especially. Now, we didn't support Joe Biden for President, you probably guessed that. But if we're being totally honest here, and we want to be honest, we have to say it was very hard to disagree with this specific part of the address. Watch. JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: On this January day, my whole soul is in this, bringing America together, uniting our people, uniting our nation. And I asked every American to join me in this cause. With unity, we can do great things, important things. CARLSON: Bringing America together, Biden said. Uniting our people, uniting our nation, to which we said as we watched it and we meant it when we did. Amen. Unity. That is precisely what this country needs more than it needs anything. We are all in this together, every single American and we have no choice but to hang together. Let's finally accept that we are one country and act like we are and make this a better place for everyone. Unity. No decent person opposes that. If Joe Biden can bring unity to this country, he will be a legitimately great President. But there's a catch. There always is a catch. We're going to bring America together, Joe Biden told us today, but not everyone is going to be included. Unity doesn't mean every single American because not everyone who is born within our borders really is an American, some of us are beyond the pale of citizenship, morally. We may have American passports and birth certificates, but effectively, we are hostile foreigners, we are the enemy, we must be defeated. Here is who Joe Biden says those people are. BIDEN: A rise of political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must confront, and we will defeat. CARLSON: We will defeat political extremists, domestic terrorists, white supremacist, those are America's enemies. We must wage war against them. We must, quote, ""defeat"" those people. That's what Biden said today. It seemed like a highly significant part of his speech and maybe a significant part of the Democratic Party's governing agenda going forward. We're not imagining this. We weren't the only ones who noticed it. People who voted for Joe Biden heard it, too. Watch. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I heard a declaration of war against white supremacy and against the lies that brought our democracy to the brink. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And President-elect Biden will inherit an unprecedented domestic security crisis. CARLSON: A declaration of war against white supremacy. Now, you may not have noticed that because then on one level, it's not very remarkable. Not many Americans support white supremacy. Most people in this country find it disgusting, of course, and they should. But the question is, what is it exactly? Now that we're waging war on white supremacists, can somebody tell us in very clear language what a white supremacist is? That's not some Picayune semantic question. Joe Biden isn't a high school debate coach, Joe Biden is the new President of the United States. Joe Biden controls the largest military and largest law enforcement agencies in the world. He has now declared war. So we should know specifically and precisely who exactly he has declared war on. We have a right to know that. Innocent people could be hurt in this war, they usually are. There could be collateral damage in this war, and the casualties will be Americans. So again, what is a white supremacist? You might be surprised to learn just how broad the definition for that has become. Bloomberg News has described a wall on our southern border as, quote, ""a monument"" to white supremacy so be certain not to support that. Colin Kaepernick who seems to have the unequivocal support of Corporate America calls the Fourth of July an example of white supremacy. So you'd better put away the fireworks and the hotdogs. The United States Army, a trusted institution, if there ever was one has used an entire manual on what is and what is not white supremacy. So you should know this. Among the telltale signs of a committed white supremacist are these: celebrating Columbus Day, using the term American exceptionalism, any support for Federal border security or English only measures or, quote, ""education funding from property taxes,"" all white supremacy. Using the phrase, ""There's only one human race"" is white supremacy, too, according to the Army, and of course, voting for Donald Trump, all white supremacy. Here's the problem. Let's say you don't buy those definitions. Let's say you're, for example, white foot poor, and you have trouble accepting the idea that you're benefiting from some kind of structural advantage. We better shut up about it if you know what's good for you because according to the United States Army, the quote, ""denial of white privilege"" is a classic sign of yes, white supremacy, so no complaining. You can see the problem with this, we definitely can see the problem. This show was not on the air for six months before there was an organized and highly aggressive campaign by prominent Democrats to denounce us as white supremacist. The first time it happened, the people who work on this show, many of them kids, were shocked and horrified by that. White supremacists? What's worse than that? The phrase evokes images of burning crosses and lynchings. It's awful. In our case, it was totally undeserved. This show is completely opposed to the practice of judging people on the basis of their skin color. We have said that repeatedly every week for four years. No show in all media has said it more or meant it more sincerely. Why have we said that? Why are we opposed to judging people on the basis of their race? Not simply because we were taught to oppose doing that though we were, but because it's immoral, and it's immoral because we believe in God. That's the real answer. Believing in God doesn't make you a good person, unfortunately. But believing in God does answer the question of where we came from. God made us, that's what believers believe. Once you understand that, it is impossible to think that any one race is inherently better or worse than any other race, because God made every person. God assigns an identical moral value to every individual. God cares about all of us equally. So we are judged by what we do, not by how we were born. We really believe that. Most Americans really believe that. It's not an accident that Martin Luther King was a Christian Minister and that Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong were not. Secular leaders are the ones most likely to count their populations by race, and then to embrace collective punishment. Through history, they often have. We've said all of that before in the show many times. So the question is, why have they kept denouncing us, as of all things, white supremacists? We thought a lot about that, you should think a lot about it, too now that the Biden administration has declared war on people they claim to have white supremacist ideas. In our case, it all started when we began criticizing the people in charge. Other channels fill their air with attacks on so-called Proud Boys, whoever they are, or the QAnon enthusiasts or gun owners in Central Pennsylvania who fix air conditionings for a living and tend to vote the wrong way. They go after those people, and you can see why. Attacking those people isn't hard. None of them have real power. They don't -- let's be honest, they don't. But private equity does have power, a lot of power. So does Google, so does Citibank, so does the government of China, so does even silly, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with her massive social media accounts. Those are the people who run our country. They don't like to be criticized. On the other hand, they don't care to defend themselves directly with reason and fact, often they can't do that. So instead, they denounce you, your critics, their critics, as white supremacists. And then they just ignore what you say. Fine. We've dealt with this for years, we're used to it. It no longer hurts our feelings, we understand what's going on. But there's a new regime in power starting today and they seem to be planning to accelerate things dramatically. They're getting the F.B.I. and The Pentagon involved in this hunt for people who may criticize them. That's a very big change, and you should understand what it's really about. Jason Whitlock is a journalist. We're always happy to have him on the show. Jason, thanks so much for coming on tonight. No one ever says this, but I think it's true that the bulwark against white supremacy, supremacy of any kind, racial supremacy of any kind is faith. And that people of faith are far less likely, in fact, they're commanded not to judge people on the basis of how they were born. Why does nobody say that? JASON WHITLOCK, OUTKICK.COM: Tucker, I'm so glad you're going there because you're speaking the absolute truth. This is secular values blossoming and coming into power, and the left and this power elite, I just can't blame just the left. Political elites are demonizing the people they are supposed to represent. This is an attack on the American people. Black people, as I said on Monday are being fooled into thinking this is some sort of defense of us. It is not. When you start talking about basically a war on white supremacy, basically a war on people that you disagree with politically, because that's all this is, whoever the left disagrees with, gets painted as a white supremacist. It's happened to me, I'm black. I'm proudly black with two black parents, black siblings. I'm in no denial. I'm actually -- I'm proud of being black. But now because I express conservative values, conservative non-political values, I'm seen as a friend of white supremacists. I'm a white supremacist. Anybody that disagrees with the left is a white supremacist. And now with this war on white supremacy, just like the war on drugs was an attack on the working class and poor, we are about to see it all over again. And I just want to reach out to black people and quit -- let's quit being used as a pawn by a political organization, the left, Democrats. They're punching down. They're attacking 75 million people that voted for Trump. And in that attack, they're also attacking you, trust me. CARLSON: Exactly. WHITLOCK: At some point, they're coming for you as well. This is not a defensive view, this whole thing. I've lived long enough to know the racial progress America has made. And so we're -- so today, in his speech about white supremacy and people, Nicolle Wallace talking about truth and the lies that have been told that have justified this violence at the Capitol. What about the lies we listened to all summer about the police killing black people randomly? And they got everybody wound up and riots and violence all across the country. Police officers assassinated, citizens assassinated. No one gets blamed for that. But people walk into the Capitol, unarmed. And this is the -- this is Pearl Harbor. This is 9/11 all over again. And we have to have a war on white supremacy, like we had a war on terror. They've got to cut it out, Tucker. They've got to cut it out, this is dangerous. CARLSON: I agree. I'm worried and it is about power, or else they would make the faith base case against racism, which is one that you and I grew up with in this country. Don't judge other people, because what matters is inside. Right? I wonder, you mentioned the BLM Movement that really kind of took over a lot of the country, funded by our most powerful corporations over the summer. That is a political movement. Put it in context for us, what would you compare that to? WHITLOCK: Well, I compare Black Lives Matter to the KKK. I really do, and some people don't understand it. But if you go back to the 1860s, after the Emancipation Proclamation, the KKK was started, and it was the enforcement arm of the Democratic Party. And what's the enforcement arm of the Democratic Party right now? Black Lives Matter and Antifa. They will come to your home and violate your home, try to intimidate the people in your home, if they disagree with you, politically. Black Lives Matter is a Marxist organization. Marxism is hostile towards religion. That's why I'm glad you went there today. These are atheist values being expressed from our leaders, demonizing individual citizens here in America, branding them as white supremacists because they decided, because we disagree with their opinion about something. This is lunacy. And it's dangerous. CARLSON: What I love about your analysis, and I think the reason you're able to see this so clearly, when so many others don't is you understand these struggles, as about power, as one group trying to impose its will upon another. That really is the central dynamic in politics. It is power. Right? It's not primarily race, its power. And I don't know why that's done obvious to more people. WHITLOCK: They've come up with a strategy Tucker, the Democrats. You've got to tip your hat to them. It's an evil strategy, but it is working. They have convinced the public, if you want to not be considered racist, support Democrats, support the left. That's the way to inoculate yourself from ever being accused of racism or being a sellout to your black race. That is their political strategy. That's what they're offering the people. We can protect you from being smeared as a racist. Joe Biden offered no policies today. There were platitudes and generalizations and attacks on President Trump. There was no vision expressed for America and how we move this country forward. There was no offer of unity. Again, as we said, a week or two ago, you have to reach out to these 75 million people and say, hey, I know you're struggling, and I know you're frustrated with this country. Let's have a conversation and let's quit smearing each other. Let me hear your concerns and try to address some of them. We're not doing that, so I don't see any unity being promoted. CARLSON: And boy, would I think all of us would be so grateful for unity. Jason Whitlock, I appreciate your coming on tonight. Thank you for your clarity. So Joe Biden doesn't seem like an extremist; probably, he isn't an extremist. He seems like kind of a gentle older man. But if you listen carefully to what he said and what his allies have been saying for the past couple of weeks, we are now in a new war on terror, but it's a domestic war focused inward on the people of this country. What does that mean for the rest of us? Glenn Greenwald will assess what it means after the break. CARLSON: Not a lot of actual policies talked about at the Inauguration today, but the new President, Joe Biden did declare a brand new war on domestic terrorism which does seem like the headline. We've been waiting for this for a little while. The country's intelligence establishment seems to be salivating at the thought of treating fellow Americans like ISIS.  JOHN BRENNAN, FORMER C.I.A. DIRECTOR: We are now looking forward that the members of the Biden team who have been nominated or have been appointed, are now moving in laser like fashion to try to uncover as much as they can about what looks very similar to insurgency movements that we've seen overseas, where they germinate in different parts of the country and they gain strength and it brings together an unholy alliance frequently of religious extremists, authoritarians, fascists, bigots, racists, Nativists, even libertarians. And unfortunately, I think there has been this momentum that has been generated as a result of unfortunately the demagogue rhetoric of people that's just departed government, but also those who continue in the Halls of Congress. CARLSON: Oh, an unholy alliance, if you will. Because I am stupid, I speak exclusively in cliches, but I was still able somehow to run the C.I.A., which ought to tell you something a lot really about the rottenness of our system. But the headline here is insurgents. What you're hearing is the people who disagree with me or may criticize me or in fact, insurgents. And of course, politicians love the idea of this. Brad Schneider, for example, is a congressman from Illinois. He has introduced something called the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act, to make it a lot easier to spy on the Americans who are paying for the spy agencies. Watch. QUESTION: Would you like to see more monitoring of radical Domestic movements? REP. BRAD SCHNEIDER (D-IL): Well, the short answer is yes. That's the purpose of this bill. CARLSON: Yes, short answer is yes for the purpose of this bill. Glenn Greenwald, is the most independent of independent journalists. He writes on ""Substack,"" where we hope you support him. He joins us tonight. Glenn, this is starting to make me a little bit nervous. Do the rest of us have cause to be concerned about this trend? GLENN GREENWALD, JOURNALIST: Absolutely. A lot of times, if you warn of a danger, you have to piece things together in order to demonstrate that it's actually coming in this case, you don't have to. They're explicitly saying precisely what they want to do. The thing that struck me so much about that John Brennan video is it would be one thing if they were saying, look, there's a band of people 20 here 50 over here who wear swastika armbands, who still are in the KKK, there's maybe 2,000 we need to -- that's not what they're saying. What he is saying is the exact opposite. Every group he lifted, even libertarians. Essentially, he is defining the insurgency as anyone who has an ideology, other than neoliberalism. In other words, other than the ruling class of you that is about to congeal and merge with the power of the state. And what they're talking about explicitly, Tucker, is using the tools that they used to take ISIS off the internet, the tools that they used to destroy al Qaeda. They're talking about it as a second war on terror, and that first war and terror no matter what your views were originally at the beginning of 9/11 ended up eroding, not civil liberties, just elsewhere, but here at home as well. One that is born by name of being a domestic orienteer designed to essentially criminalize any oppositional ideology to the ruling class. There is literally nothing that could be more dangerous, and it's not fear mongering or alarmism to say it. There are bills pending by Adam Schiff as well that would simply take the existing war on terror legislation always aimed at foreign governments and foreign actors and simply amend it to say we can now do that within the United States. CARLSON: Who is going to stand up in opposition to this? I don't see any of the Corporate Republican Caucus really even noticing. I see a lot of people I thought were liberal turned out to be not liberal at all, but more authoritarian. So how do we prevent this from happening? Any idea? GREENWALD: Well, one of the things -- one of the things I'm really hoping for is that we can finally get out of enough people believing that the way to understand Washington is Democrat versus Republican and that you side with one team and believe they're on your side and defending your interest and the other team is your enemy. It is not true. There is a ruling class elite that is extremely comfortable with the establishment wings of both parties. They love Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and everybody as much as they love Mitch McConnell and Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio and Paul Ryan. Those are the people who they fund equally, because those are the people who serve their agenda. Then there's a whole other huge group of people at whose expense they roll in. Some of them consider themselves on the left and some consider themselves on the right, and it's time to break down those barriers. I was super enthused to see a group of eight left-wing politicians, including Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar and others say, we will not allow a new war on terror because we know how dangerous it can be. Let them stand with right-wing members to break down this artificial false fraudulent prism that the way to understand Washington is thinking that one of the two parties is on your side, neither of them is. CARLSON: I don't think a lot of people are going to be saving that permanently what you just said on their DVRs. And I certainly hope they do because you're right. Glenn Greenwald, thank you very much. GREENWALD: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: So the censorship campaign that we're living under now and that appears to be accelerating, it just took an entire social media platform off the internet and disappeared it, but it began to begin in earnest in October right before the election when Big Tech united as one to censor a very specific story that ran in ""The New York Post,"" the country's oldest newspaper, and that story as you'll remember was about the Biden family's influence peddling operation. Now the Big Tech companies told us that was disinformation. It wasn't, it was all true. In fact, there is still an active Federal investigation into Joe Biden's family, excuse me, his son about his overseas business dealings. Just before the election, we spoke to a man called Tony Bobulinski, who was in fact a business partner of the Bidens and knew the details. Here's part of what he told us. TONY BOBULINSKI, FORMER BUSINESS AFFILIATE OF HUNTER BIDEN: And so then Hunter and his father and security came through the bar. And obviously, I stood up out of respect to shake his hand. And Hunter introduced me as, ""This is Tony, dad. The individual I told you about that's helping us with the business that we're working on and the Chinese."" CARLSON: So it was clear to you that Joe Biden's son had told him about this business deal. BOBULINSKI: Crystal clear. CARLSON: Now, the White House aligned with Silicon Valley has to make a decision. Will the media -- will they allow the media effectively to cover the story anymore? It's hard to imagine we're even asking that question in this country. But we have to because it's a real question. Miranda Devine is a columnist for ""The New York Post."" She has been on the story since the first day it came out and reporting on it for us. Miranda, thanks so much for coming on. So this raises a really interesting and obvious question I have not heard asked before, which is what do you do about a story about the President and his family now that the President is actually the President? MIRANDA DEVINE, COLUMNIST, ""THE NEW YORK POST"": Hi, Tucker. Well, I don't really hold out much hope that a very incurious media is going to change their tune. You could say that Joe Biden won the election because of the censorship and the favorable reporting that he received. And now, you saw just from the first press conference just a little over an hour ago that the media is really eating out of the Biden administration's hands. Only one reporter, that was Peter Doocy, from FOX News, asked a question that was difficult and that was one about unity. How can you possibly be preaching unity when you're trying to impeach your predecessor? So I don't think that anything will change. And all we saw before the election was that the media was quite happy to accept some complete nonsense from people like John Brennan and his former colleagues, the spooks, so-called, who told us that the Hunter Biden laptop was Russian disinformation. Well, it wasn't. But now they have a new bogeyman, and as you rightly said, Joe Biden put it out there in his supposedly unifying inauguration speech today, it is domestic terrorists. It is white supremacists. And the definition of that depends on whether you're with us or you're against us. CARLSON: That's exactly right. I can't imagine a less unifying way to organize your administration. Miranda Devine, I know that you will continue to be on the story. I appreciate your coming on. Thank you. DEVINE: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: Think for a minute, by the way, just to pause about John Brennan. John Brennan, we can't say this enough, ran the C.I.A., the most powerful Intel gathering agency in the world. And yet now that John Brennan is regularly on TV, you know his secret, which is John Brennan is not very smart. He's just like a dumb partisan. He's not even a very good talking head. How did our country promote over decades someone as totally mediocre as John Brennan to a position of authority like that? We need to figure out what we're doing wrong here. When people like John Brennan ascend to the top of the C.I.A., it's a broken system. Well, up next, in the name of unity, Joe Biden has just hired someone who believes that disciplining children in school is, of course another tool of white supremacy and racist. That's not just a dumb opinion. It's an opinion that's going to have actual effects on schools and your kids. We will tell you what those may be, after the break. CARLSON: If you've been flipping around the dial, you may have noticed that all the other news channels have basically connected their cameras directly to what we call the pool feed, and they're just carrying completely unaltered footage right from the Joe Biden celebration. We don't mean any disrespect to the presidency or even to the person who occupies it as of tonight when we say there's a lot going on, and so we're going to bring you news for this hour. Instead, we will I think dip in briefly as Joe Biden speaks for the first time in primetime. But in the meantime, we want to tell you what's going on because it matters. So Democrats and the media are welcoming what is in effect, the military occupation of your capital city, 26,000 Federal troops. There are more than who were there in 1864 during the Civil War. But just last year, our political class had a very different view of the National Guard and indeed, the whole topic of law and order. Heather Mac Donald knows more about law and order and the effective use of the police may be anyone in America. She's a fellow with the Manhattan Institute and wrote a great book on the topic. We're happy to have her tonight. Heather, what do you make of what we're seeing in Washington right now? HEATHER MAC DONALD, FELLOW, MANHATTAN INSTITUTE: It's hilarious, Tucker. This summer, ""The New York Times"" published an op-ed by Senator Tom Cotton merely broaching the idea of calling out the National Guard to quell the murderous anarchic riots that were tearing apart American cities. This op- ed was viewed as so injurious to the health of ""The New York Times"" black employees that the op-ed editor had to resign. Now those same ""New York Times"" employees and the rest of the mainstream media are cheering on the militarization not just with the nation's capital, but of all 50 state capitals. Now, why might this be, Tucker? Is there a sudden newfound respect for law and order and for the police officers of this country? Of course not. The Biden administration has already declared that it's going to reinvigorate the war on cops that the Obama administration prosecuted. Now the reason that they are loving the tanks, the barbed wire, the guys in military riot gear is because they serve as a visual symbol for what is going to be the dominant theme of the Biden administration, which is that the greatest threat in America today is the so-called rising tide of systemic racism and white supremacy. That's a lie, but it's a lie that allows them to get to an even bigger agenda, something you've been covering relentlessly, Tucker, that is the biggest worry right now to our constitutional liberties, which is the use - - the attempts to destroy First Amendment protections for conservative speech on the idea that it is giving rise to this threat of domestic terrorism. CARLSON: Well, sure, if they can tell you what you can say, they can control what you think, and once they can do that, they can do anything to you. So it does seem to me it's not just hypocrisy, they were against it, now, they're for it. It's revealing of their actual agenda, like they don't have any problem with force or fascism, obviously. MAC DONALD: Well, obviously, yes. For them, they want it. If anybody else in the suburbs or in the inner city, says actually, we need the cops. You can't say that, because that entails more systemic racism and the lie that governs the left. But as soon as they don't have any need ideologically for the cops, they're going to be right back in the dog trash heap, which is where they've been for the last 10 years under Democratic ideology. CARLSON: Totally true. The Great Heather Mac Donald, thank you. MAC DONALD: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: And they put a finer point on it by the way, as we reported the other day, Democrats in Congress has been working to ban the civilian ownership of body armor, a completely defensive measure that people take to prevent getting killed by bullets. They don't want you to be able to have that, to possess that, it would be a felony to have it in your house. Democratic Members of Congress today announced they were wearing body armor at the Inauguration. Meditate on that for a minute. Meanwhile, Catherine Lhamon is Joe Biden's picked to be the Deputy Director of something called the Domestic Policy Council for Racial Justice and Equity, not equality, which is what we are in favor of, all Americans are, but equity, something very different. As you might expect, that means she is not for equality or against racism. She favors overt racial discrimination for the benefit of groups she believes vote for the Democratic Party. She was in the Obama administration. And at that time, Catherine Lhamon threatened several school districts with civil action. Why? Because more African-American students were getting suspended than white students. Therefore, she concluded by definition, those schools must be racist. She couldn't think of another explanation. Then in April of 2018, Lhamon came on this show to defend race based admissions policies. I've got to give her credit for saying it out loud. She did. Just like Kristen Clarke, Joe Biden's pick to head the D.O.J. Civil Rights Division who is actually kind of a lunatic for real, Catherine Lhamon believes that someone's appearance matters more than what they do. CARLSON: There are groups in America, particularly African-Americans who were discriminated against historically and this is a way of making good on that for trying. So how does it make you feel when you see the numbers that foreign born black students, displace African-American students, especially at prestigious schools at really high rate, and then the school gets the say the word diverse when they're letting in, you know, the kid of the Nigerian Ambassador? Does that seem a perversion of the purpose? CATHERINE LHAMON, PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN' S NOMINEE AS DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF DOMESTIC POLICY COUNCIL FOR RACIAL JUSTICE AND EQUITY: Well, I think it might be a perversion of the purpose. I haven't seen those numbers. And that's not my experience from investigating the school. So I again, need to resist your reduction of the applicant to a particular characteristic rather than looking at the whole picture. CARLSON: Well, the schools, of course, reduced them to that. I mean, they are totally race conscious ... LHAMON: No, they don't. CARLSON: ... in the way that they do admission. LHAMON: You know, let me tell you that that is just not true. CARLSON: That's really funny. You can't reduce people to their race. You've got to look at the whole person. Which is the point we were making and make every single night. Peter Kirsanow makes that point and has for decades. He is a member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. He works with women you just saw on that tape, we're happy to have him on tonight. Peter, what do you think of this choice? And what will its effects be? PETER KIRSANOW, MEMBER, U.S. COMMISSION ON CIVIL RIGHTS: Well, the effects will be perpetuation of racial and identity politics on steroids, even more so than we've seen the last year. The clips that you've played with respect to Catherine and her position with respect to race, especially with respect to education, we've had hearings at the Civil Rights Commission where positions and in fact, if you look at her opinions that she has written after we've had hearings, make it very clear that what we're about to engage in is, again, racial politics on steroids. The presumption is it's a demonstrably false and indeed inane presumption that almost every disparity on the basis of race is the result of systemic racism or outright white supremacy. And, you know, there are no other reasons for disparities. And it results in things like the school discipline policy that she enforced while she was a member of the U.S. Office of Civil Rights for the Department of Education that presumed that disparities in suspensions and discipline in schools is a result of racism. So schools in order to abide by this guidance engaged in quotas. Now, what that also resulted in in terms of suspensions, so you had kids who are violent and acting out remaining in class, and as a result of that, predictably what happened was that the amount of violence in schools skyrocketed. We had a hearing in which teachers testified that they were being beaten, one suffered brain damage. Hundreds of thousands of students per year polled said they missed at least one day of school because of fear of going for school, it was a concrete disaster. But this is what happens when you count by race. This is what happens when you don't take into consideration very well-known reasons for why there are disparities that have absolutely nothing to do with racism. And in 2021, the good news is, it is rarely vanishingly rare the case that racism promotes or is the cause for disparities on the basis of race, but we're going to see more and more stress on identity politics, more and more stress on structural causes of racism that permit for the kind of social engineering under the guise of trying to remedy racial disparities. CARLSON: Man, they're going to hurt the country. No hope for unity under the regime you just described, unfortunately. Peter Kirsanow, I appreciate it. It's sad. KIRSANOW: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: Thank you. Well, the media class has already established some pretty firm ground rules for the Biden administration. For example, you cannot talk about Kamala or is it Kamala -- hard to know -- you noticed that Justice Sonia Sotomayor got it wrong, maybe we think -- in any way that's not fawningly positive. That's deeply sexist, if you do. Go get reprogrammed, misogynist. Of course, that rule does not apply to the media. When CBS News runs entire segments on Kamala Harris's shoes, it is not offensive. It is indeed empowering. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'll tell you when you walked in, I checked out, is she wearing them? You're not wearing your Chucks today. KAMALA HARRIS (D), VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What is the story? HARRIS: It became a story, I've always worn Chucks. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well, what's the story? HARRIS: It's my casual go-to, you know, I grew up with Chucks. I just love them. They are comfortable. DOUG EMHOFF, HUSBAND OF KAMALA HARRIS: I can attest. There are several closets full of them. HARRIS: He is exaggerating. CARLSON: Can you imagine? You're interviewing one of the most powerful people in the world, maybe the most powerful person in the world. You're a journalist, your job is to inform your viewers and your readers about what they can expect from their government. But instead, you degrade yourself by asking about her shoes. Quick slobber over Kamala's shoes. Over at MSNBC, her shoes were not the highlight. They were focused on more important matters like how Michelle Obama was dressed today. Watch. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Can I just remark of how flawless Michelle Obama is? I'm sorry. I don't mean to be obsessive. She really understands how to dress for the moment and how to look stylish, but also powerful. She really is just masterful at it. CARLSON: She's just masterful. Would it be hilarious if someone on the set said, I don't think she looks that good. Honestly, it's not really flattering. You wouldn't lose your job if you did that. I'd love to see it though. Speaking of losing their job, Jim Acosta at CNN lost his job, you may not have read that. He is no longer going to be their Chief White House correspondent. He's still oppressed though. Today, Jim Acosta celebrated the ouster of a dictator, a fascist so bad that Jim Acosta got a book deal out of criticizing him. Those words are behind us now, thank God. Jim Costa is celebrating, the dictator is gone. JIM ACOSTA, CNN CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: So Anderson this is looking like, you know, a President or a foreign Head of State, leading Washington. And, you know, in a way, because the President is defying these traditions of not being a part of the inauguration of President Joe Biden, he is almost leaving town like an autocrat ousted from power heading off into exile. CARLSON: It's just hilarious that someone who is literally wearing a black mask on camera is calling someone else a fascist. Why are you wearing a mask? You're not going to get COVID outside at a live shot. This is just performance art, and it's very tiresome. Please stop. Will they stop? How long will this go on exactly? Steve Krakauer is the editor of the ""Fourth Watch"" podcast. He joins us tonight, Steve, one of my hopes is to be able to watch television, again, without gritting my teeth, just like basic news coverage. Are we ever going to get that do you think? STEVE KRAKAUER, FOUNDER, ""FOURTH WATCH"": Yes, I don't know. Because it does feel like the pendulum is starting to swing a whole different direction right now. Look, I think if there was one positive that came from the Trump era, it was the journalists sort of rediscovered the idea that the press should serve the public and be a check on power, and it should have an adversarial relationship with the power now. Now, the press in the Trump era went completely overboard and became you know, this is this evil, you know, dictatorship that we're covering. But at least that's, you know -- maybe if you could take some of those lessons and bring that to the Biden era. CARLSON: Right, I agree. KRAKAUER: I think we're going to -- yes, I'm not sure we're going to see that. You know, I had Olivia Nuzzi, who is one of the few reporters in D.C. who I actually trust may keep that adversarial relationship go into the next era. She was on my podcast and she described that a lot of D.C. based journalists are motivated by the reluctance to make one's social life uncomfortable. So the idea is, look, you can be mean to Kayleigh McEnany and you can interrupt her all day, and you're just going to get praised on Twitter and no one is going to care. Everyone's going to beat -- you know, you're going to get more Twitter followers. If you start doing that to Jen Psaki, you start interrupting her, you're going to be -- you know, you're going to be a misogynist, or you know, a mansplainer, and you're not going to get invited to the same parties that probably Jen Psaki is going to. And you're certainly going to get, you know, railed against on Twitter. So, yes, I'm very concerned about the way that this is going to go, and I think that, that what we're -- if it's any indication of where things were in the Obama years, and frankly, even a little bit in the Bush years, I think that we need to have a press that is motivated to be adversarial. And I'm not sure we're seeing that, particularly, as I'm seeing all of these tweets right now from people saying that they are so tired and exhausted from the last four years, kind of not giving good signs of where things are about to go next. CARLSON: I totally agree. And I agree with you about Olivia Nuzzi by the way. I don't know her politics are, but she's smart. A lot of dumb people in the media. I think all the smart ones went into finance or something. It's kind of the slow second son goes over to work at NBC. It it's very sad, because we kind of need a competent media. Hey, great to see you tonight. Thank you. KRAKAUER: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: Well, Joe Biden, as we told you at the outset, we applauded it, as he did called for unity today, which is the thing we need more than anything. So if you really meant it, why wouldn't he? And well, he is the question. Call on his allies in the monopolies in Silicon Valley to stop censoring people, Americans.' Vivek Ramaswamy has thought a lot about that question, a lot. He's a tech entrepreneur, author of the forthcoming book, ""Woke, Inc.,"" which we plan to read. Vivek, thanks so much for coming on. So if you wanted to unify the country, why wouldn't you just say, look, people get to speak freely. And I may disagree, but I can handle it because I'm an American. Do you think he will do that? VIVEK RAMASWAMY, TECH ENTREPRENEUR: Look, as an American, I hope he does. But the single most powerful thing he could do tonight is get on the phone with Jack Dorsey and call on Big Tech to give Donald Trump's Twitter account back and to do the same thing for thousands of conservatives who were removed over the last few weeks because as Americans, we don't just silence the people we disagree with. We engage with them. We debate them. And for the President of the United States to step up and do that would be a small step actually, for Joe Biden, but I think it would be a big step forward for this country. CARLSON: No, I think that really would. I mean, I would unequivocally praise him. I think all people of principle would do that. So do you think that he will? RAMASWAMY: Look, I have a big doubt as to whether he will, because he is the President of the United States today and no longer the President-elect or a candidate. So I'd like to give him a chance. But I think, Tucker, the real question is equally on the other side, as well for the conservative movement to ask ourselves: what is the real enemy today? And it isn't 1980 anymore. It isn't just big government. It is the - - you talked about it. There was a joke about an unholy marriage earlier on the show. CARLSON: Yes. RAMASWAMY: It's the unholy marriage of Big Government and Big Tech and Big Business that we really ought to take aim at. CARLSON: That's right. That's totally right. Way scarier than anything we've faced before. Vivek, I appreciate your coming on. I know we will see you again. RAMASWAMY: Thank you. CARLSON: So as we told you, Joe Biden, newly the President, speaking for the first time in primetime. We haven't been carrying the infomercial all night, but we want to dip in quickly to his remarks because it's news. JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: ... liberty, dignity and respect, and unite against common foes: hate, violence, disease and hopelessness. America's story depends not on any one of us, not on some of us, but on all of us, on we, the people. That's the task before us. The only way we'll get through the darkness around us. There are moments in our history, when more is asked of us as Americans. We saw that in the Civil War. We saw that with Dr. King dreaming from these steps across the Mall. We are in one of those moments now. The pandemic, economic crisis, racial injustice, the climate crisis, and threats to our very democracy. The question is, are we up to it? Will we meet the moment like our forebears have? I believe we must and I believe we will. You, the American people are the reason why I've never been more optimistic about America than I am this very day. There isn't anything we can't do, if we do it together and that's what you'll see tonight. Stories of ordinary Americans who do extraordinary things. That's how we'll celebrate America, and respect and represent America in our time in office. America, America, built of decency -- it is built of decency and dignity, of love and healing, of greatness and goodness, of possibilities. This is a story that guides us, inspires us, and unites us today and always. So thank you for this honor. I will give my all to you. May God bless America and may God protect our troops. CARLSON: Well, last two lines, we are in favor of, God bless America. God bless us. We want to end the show tonight on a happy note. There aren't a ton, but you're looking at a live shot of the Teddy Roosevelt statue at the Museum of Natural History in New York. Teddy Roosevelt, the greatest President we ever had, one of the greatest people who ever lived here. But since May, you have heard calls to tear the statue down. In fact, it is now planned to be torn down. The Mayor of New York said he will tear it down for reasons he has never really explained. But it is still standing tonight, and that's the point we want to make. And as long as it does stand, the country has not gone completely crazy. Mark Steyn joins us tonight to celebrate this and tell us what it means. Great to see you, Mark. MARK STEYN, AUTHOR AND COLUMNIST: Well, I think, Tucker if you listened to what we've heard today, where they are talking about how, you know, Trump's the first guy in 152 years not to attend the Inauguration of his successor or something else about some tradition going back to 1837, people have a need for history. You can't tear down history. If you tear down history, you leave a void where something false fills it instead. That's the story of every totalitarian society. So it's great to see that this thing is still standing in defiance of the mobs we saw over the summer. CARLSON: Okay, that that's maybe my favorite line of the year so far. When you tear down a history you leave a void, into it's something false can go. That is totally -- and that's the point of it, right? It's not accidental. It is a manipulation of our shared history, of our culture, of who we are. STEYN: Right and everybody -- every society needs a history and even that's what all these shallow references to piffling traditions meant today, every society needs to be part of a great historical stream. You can't remove that, you can't dam it up. It's what it is. CARLSON: So smart. So I don't know why this strikes me in the way that it does, probably, because I love Teddy Roosevelt, but also because not everything was destroyed during that spasm of mob vandalism that we saw for months that our leaders did nothing to stop. This remains. STEYN: Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. And that's despite John Brennan, you know, demonizing all kinds of people, you know, nativist, libertarians, excitable centrists, moderates, you've had a third cup of coffee with all the domestic enemies. The statue still stands. CARLSON: Are you -- this is off topic, but I can't resist because you brought up John Brennan and this is my obsession for tonight anyway, are you ever surprised once you hear the people making these grand decisions speak by how unimpressive mediocre, inarticulate, just sort of banal they are? STEYN: Absolutely. That's why, you know, they are furious at any talk of pardoning Julian Assange because we have bozos running the most lavishly funded Intelligence Community in the world and they couldn't keep their secrets, because John Brennan isn't -- shouldn't be holding that job. CARLSON: None of these people should. I mean, it would just be funny to have, like, I don't know, an hour long, unedited taped conversation with Kamala Harris about, you know, what do you think about that? What do you think about the -- what are the principles you believe it? That would be the most devastating hour of television ever made, which is why they will do whatever they can to prevent it from being made. You used to wear Chuck Taylors. STEYN: Knock it off, Tucker. Ask a question about her footwear like a respectable member of the media. CARLSON: So good. Mark Steyn, it is great to see you. Thank you so much. STEYN: Thanks a lot, Tucker. CARLSON: We are out of time. We will be back tomorrow night and every night, 8:00 p.m., the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. Sean Hannity, right now. Classification"
2021-01-26,"TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. You are watching the free speech channel: that's what it is, the last one left. For the next hour, we're going to say exactly what we believe is true. Period. It's still America. The first point to make, an obvious point that has now been banned as a thought crime in the rest of the media is that the United States government should never, under any circumstances favor one race of people over any other race of people. Period. That is immoral. We're all citizens. We're all human beings. We're all created by God. We are all equal. Every one of us has a right to equal treatment by our government. That right is guaranteed by our Constitution. It's the heart of countless laws passed with well-deserved fanfare by our Congress over many decades. That right is inscribed on a monument on our National Mall to the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. who would be shocked and disgusted if he watched Susan Rice on television today. Susan Rice is Joe Biden's Chief Domestic Policy adviser. Rice is in charge of changing our country to conform to the orthodoxies of the Democratic Party. How does Susan Rice plan to do that? Well, going forward, she announced this afternoon, quote: ""Every agency in the U.S. government,"" a government that is by the way, the largest and most lavishly funded organization in human history, every one of them will, quote, "" ... place equity at the core of its policy design,"" specifically, and for the benefit of, quote, ""marginalized communities."" Now, Susan Rice's speech was carried live by many news outlets, but as far as we know, not a single one of them paused to ask what exactly she was talking about, and they should have. The Federal government is, above all, an enormous printing press. It manufactures U.S. currency, it dispenses trillions of dollars every year. According to Rice, much of that money will now be distributed on the basis of equity. That means it will go to people who do not possess, quote, ""privilege."" So let's get very specific about what that means. What precisely is privilege? Can privilege be measured? If so, how exactly are we measuring it? Can we see the privilege formula? We should see it because a huge amount turns on the definition of this word. Some Americans won't get jobs because it's been decided they have too much privilege. Others won't get into college or get promoted or win Federal contracts. Others will see their neighborhoods change dramatically in ways they may not like because of their privilege. They'll tell you that's not true, but it is true. And before any of that happens, the rest of us deserve a clear explanation of what's going on. Who's getting rewarded? Who's getting punished? And why? We don't have to ask politely, we're American citizens. This is our government, no matter who we voted for, we're paying for it. So we can demand an answer. But of course, there isn't an answer. That's the point. They can't really define privilege. They can't tell us who in a country with no majority culture actually qualifies as a quote ""minority."" They don't want to have this conversation in the first place at all, because their views are indefensible. That's why they are general rather than precise. That's why they're trying to make us be quiet. You see those efforts all around you now. Never in American history has there been press censorship on this scale. As we noted at the top, FOX News is the last significant media organization remaining in this country that allows its employees to tell obvious truths in public. The rest of them have been muzzled or shut down completely. The last to go was the social media site, Parler, which was created as a free speech alternative to the Silicon Valley monopolies like Twitter and Facebook. A few weeks ago, those very same monopolies pulled it right off the internet. Parler no longer exists. When the history of this period is written, the destruction of Parler will get its own chapter, and so will these people. The mindless corporate shills who applauded its destruction. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Parler has zero moderation. The whole point is that this is a completely free community that you can say what you want. What it tends to have done is attracted very hard right conservatives, conspiracy theorists, racist. It's garbage. I mean the stuff on Parler is remarkable garbage. CARLSON: Oh, the stuff on Parler is remarkable garbage, announces some low IQ thug on television. Therefore, it's totally fine. Virtuous, in fact. For Amazon Web Services, the largest internet hosting service in the world, to simply unplug it, to destroy it with no debate or even coherent explanation for why they did it. Why did Amazon do that? It wasn't because they were morally offended by Parler. That can't be true. Last year, according to the Group Parents Together, a total of 69 million photos and videos of children being sexually abused reported to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, yet, only eight of those reports came from Amazon Web Services, which was hosting quite a few of them. Why is that? Apparently, Jeff Bezos didn't consider sexual abuse videos garbage. As the Director of Parents Together, put it, quote, ""Amazon Web Services has vast resources, controls a third of Cloud infrastructure services, and handles billions of uploads and downloads. Their abysmal failure to report child sex abuse material makes it clear they're not looking for it."" And of course, they're not looking for it. Whatever you think of kiddie porn, it's not like it is right of center politics, so Jeff Bezos doesn't need to censor it. We should also tell you that Amazon Web Services provides hosting services to Twitter, and according to their lawsuit, Twitter quote, "" ... benefited from and neglected to remove an exploitive video featuring a minor boy and another minor, which was retweeted thousands of times and received at least 160,000 views on its platform,"" on Twitter. The lawsuit says that the minor and his mother repeatedly asked Twitter to take down the video, the sex abuse video, but Twitter refused to do so until the Department of Homeland Security intervened. That's what it took. You're getting the picture. There's a lot of quote, ""garbage"" floating around on Amazon Web Services and on Twitter. But according to our media class, none of it would justify shutting down Amazon Web Services. Incidentally, you should also know that Amazon Web Services provides web services for the C.I.A. You're paying for it. Amazon has built datacenters in China. According to a report by the Horizon Advisory Group, Amazon runs a quote, ""Innovation Center"" in close partnership with the Communist Party of China. It's not clear what they are innovating. But whatever it is, it's not a problem for our leaders because no one in the Chinese government voted for Donald Trump. It's not like they're dangerous. But you know who is dangerous? Any American citizen who doesn't agree with MSNBC? Watch. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The whole idea of prevention needs to be examined by the new Congress. What do I mean by that? We still don't have a domestic terrorism law. We still don't treat this like we do international terrorism, change the religion of some of those people that entered the Capitol and you've got violent jihadists. You've got the F.B.I. with undercover informants, electronic surveillance, and agents in their groups and organizations because we've designated them as potentially violent. We've got nothing like that going on. CARLSON: Oh, so the government should change the religion of those people. The government now has the right to change religion. According to the G-Man on TV. That's a big change. When did this become a theocracy? The rest of us thought we were allowed to believe any religion we wanted to believe, even ones that ""Morning Joe"" doesn't understand or approve of. We imagine that was the whole point of America. Not anymore. Equity and inclusion means that you will believe what they tell you to believe. Period. Or else you're a terrorist and they can hurt you because we hurt terrorists. Listen to America's new Grand Inquisitor, Adam Schiff of California. REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): We have been urging for some time that the F.B.I. and the Department of Homeland Security raised the priority to domestic terrorism to white nationalism as it threatens the country, and we're going to continue sounding the alarm and make sure that they're devoting the resources, the time and the attention, just as we did after 9/11 to the threat from international terrorism, we need to give the same priority and urgency to domestic terrorism. CARLSON: Got that. Vote the wrong way and you are a jihadi. You thought you were an American citizen with rights and just a different view. But no, you're a jihadi. And we're going to treat you the way we treated those radicals after 9/11, the way we treated Bin Laden. Get in line, pal. This is a war on terror. Keep in mind as you listen to people talk like this, Adam Schiff is far from the only one. Keep in mind, they are talking about American citizens here. They're talking about you. But nobody seems to notice or care. One who does notice and cares quite a bit, one of the only Democrats willing to stand up and oppose this transparently fascist purge -- that is what it is -- is Tulsi Gabbard, the former Member of Congress from Hawaii. Gabbard published a video message today explaining exactly what's at stake. TULSI GABBARD, FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE: The John Brennans, Adam Schiffs and the oligarchs in Big Tech who are trying to undermine our constitutionally protected rights and turn our country into a police state with KGB-style surveillance are also domestic enemies and much more powerful and therefore dangerous than the mob that stormed the Capitol. CARLSON: What you just heard her say is true. No matter what they tell you, no matter how much they attack the person who said it -- oh, she's a tool of Assad -- it is absolutely true. That is true. And God bless Tulsi Gabbard for saying so out loud. She joins us right now to say more times. Congresswoman, we appreciate your coming on tonight. GABBARD: Thank you. CARLSON: So I don't think of you as someone given to hyperbole you're not throwing wild charges out there, you measure your words. You said, you are concerned that we are moving towards a police state. Tell us why you're worried? GABBARD: Well, Tucker, the very first thing that any President does after they've gotten elected, any Member of Congress and every one of us who has served in the military is we take an oath and we swear to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. The reason that this is the first thing that we do is because our Constitution is the foundation of this country and who we are. It is what guarantees us our civil liberties, our freedoms that are endowed to us, not by any man or person in government, but are endowed to us by our Creator, and so this is something that we must all unite around. This is something that we recognize that those who stormed the Capitol on January 6 trying to stop Congress from fulfilling their constitutional responsibilities, they were acting as domestic terrorists undermining our Constitution. As you pointed out in my video, those like John Brennan, Adam Schiff, and others, are also acting as domestic terrorists because they are also undermining our Constitution by trying to take away our civil liberties and rights that are guaranteed to us. If you don't mind, I'd like to just quote John Brennan directly so that people can't say I'm taking this out of context, directly, John Brennan says: ""Members of the Biden team who have been nominated or appointed are now moving in laser-like fashion to try to uncover as much as they can about what looks very similar to insurgency movements they've seen overseas where they germinate in different parts of the country and gain strength and bring together an unholy alliance, frequently of religious extremists, authoritarians, fascist bigots, racist, nativist, and even libertarians."" This is the extent that they are going to try to undermine the rights and freedoms that are guaranteed to every one of us, and it is incredibly dangerous. CARLSON: It is so dangerous and it's also happening on a greater scale we've ever seen before, because as you point out in the video that I hope every one of our viewers will find on the internet, it isn't simply government officials and our Intel and law enforcement agencies, it's also private businesses. It's these giant tech monopolies. What can the rest of us do to protect ourselves to keep free speech alive in a moment when it is being crushed all around us? GABBARD: First of all, keep speaking. I think this is the most important thing at a time when there is so much fear and threats, and the kind of fomenting of fear that we're seeing coming from the likes of John Brennan, take a stand. We must all take a stand and unite around these principles in our Constitution and continue to speak freely, whether it be in person on the street corner, or on these virtual public squares, these town squares that exist online. You know, Big Tech is culpable in this in that they are using their monopolistic power to pick and choose whose voices are heard and whose voices are squelched, whether it's based on who they agree with, disagree with, political affiliation, who you voted for, or whatever. I think there are alternative platforms, I've got one on tulsi.locals.com. It's a place where people can come and speak freely and have open dialogue and conversation around different issues based on respect and this appreciation for our constitutional rights and freedoms. But I think most importantly, we need to urge President Biden and every Member of Congress how critical it is they take a stand and denounce the likes of John Brennan and Adam Schiff's actions, because if we do not, and if they do not, then this country that we love and cherish will no longer exist. CARLSON: I think that's right. When you ran for President as a Democrat, I watched the leadership of the Democratic Party try to subvert your campaign. They disliked you more than they disliked Donald Trump almost. And now, I think we know why because you're defending the basic institutions of our country and I appreciate you doing it on this show. Tulsi Gabbard, thank you. GABBARD: Thank you. CARLSON: Well, of course, you will likely recognize our next guest. His name is Mike Lindell. He runs My Pillow. He advertises every night on this show and across FOX News. He is one of our biggest sponsors and we are grateful for that. He is sponsoring free speech when he does it. But of course, the enforcers of orthodoxy are not impressed. They're enraged. For the crime of having different opinions, Mike Lindell has just been banned from Twitter. Several retailers have also stopped selling his products. That happened today. That would include Bed Bath and Beyond, Kohl's and Kroger. Again, Bed Bath and Beyond, Kohl's and Kroger. Those are just a few. When you support freedom of speech, you're no longer allowed to speak. That's the new rule. This network is one of the last places in this country where Americans are allowed to speak. We're honored to have Mike Lindell on tonight to give his perspective. One note for you, the transmission line that connects his studio to our studio got cut minutes before the show. We are not exactly sure how, but thankfully, Mike Lindell, the CEO of My Pillow has FaceTime and he is on it right now. Mike, thanks so much for coming on. MIKE LINDELL, CEO, MY PILLOW: Thanks for having me on Tucker. That list is bigger. There's also HGTV, the shopping channel, Shop HQ. I mean, they just keep, you know, turning in their POs and saying, we don't want My Pillow anymore. CARLSON: So your views on politics, whether our viewers or anyone else agrees to them or not-- are the views of millions of other people, and you've expressed them, you have now been shut down. It seems pretty clear, they are sending a message. People -- the public recognizes, we cannot step out of line because you might convince others to do the same. Do you take another message? Or do you think that's why they're doing this to you? LINDELL: Well, this one, you know, I've always backed this great, great President Donald Trump. I've always had his back since 2016 when I first met him. But when I went back to Minnesota in 2016, to say, hey, I met the candidate Donald Trump. I was attacked by bots and trolls, and I reached out to the media and did a press release, and I was just called a racist and everything you could imagine. And I thought, wow, are these people real? No, they weren't real, they are attack groups and their bots and trolls, so I've been through this before. Last spring, I spoke out at the Rose Garden and said we should all get in our Bibles and reach out to Jesus, stay in the word, spend time with their families. We were attacked then. So we're used to this and my job. But this time is different. This time about 17 days ago, when someone put up on the on the internet, actual machine, new machine election fraud, I retweeted it and they took my Twitter down. Now, when they took it down -- this is interesting, they didn't take it down all the way, I just couldn't do anything and they were running my Twitter like they were me. My friends were going, you're not tweeting very much and when you do -- I said, I'm not doing that. So I tried to take it down and I got a tweet, a thing from Germany saying these are the Twitter rules and you cannot do this, take anything down. So they ran my Twitter for about 14 days to 15 days. Then yesterday, they put it back up so I could run it and I made one tweet and the tweet was a good a good letter written by one of my employees because I'm getting attacked about my integrity and stuff, and they took it down five minutes later. And then a week ago, they did -- Dominion went on TV and said they were going to go after Mike Lindell. Well, they did. They hired hit groups and bots and trolls, went after all my vendors, all these box stores to cancel me out. This cancel culture, fake stories coming out to attack my Lindell Recovery Network, which helps addicts across the country. It's just a shame, Tucker, what the -- if they can do it to me, believe me, they can do it to anyone out there. But we're not -- I'm not backing down. We cannot back down out of fear this time. Nobody can. CARLSON: I totally agree. LINDELL: I told these -- you guys, these aren't real people. These are trolls and bots. The real people will buy the products and will support you. You can't do this just because they cancel you -- trained cancel culture. CARLSON: May I ask you one question since you grew up in this country, if they disagree with you, or think that you're saying things that are incorrect, why don't they explain what those things are and why don't they try to convince you that you're wrong? I mean, I thought the rules were if you think someone is saying something incorrect, you explain how it's incorrect and you convince his audience that actually you're right and he is wrong. When did that go away? When did we decide force was the only answer to disagreement? LINDELL: Right. And you know, I can't even live stream on Facebook, they've shut it down. But you're exactly right, Tucker. What I say to them with this particular thing that's going on now, I've been all in trying to find the machine fraud and we found it. We have all the evidence. So what all these -- all these outlets that have been calling me from ""The Washington Post"" and ""New York Times,"" every outlet in the country, they go Mike Lindell, there's no evidence, and he's making fraudulent statements. No, I have the evidence. I dare people to put it on. I dare Dominion, just sue me because then it would get out faster. So this is -- you know, they don't want to talk about it. They don't want to say it. They just say, oh, you're wrong. And I'm going -- CARLSON: They are not making conspiracy theories go away by doing that. You don't answer -- you know, don't make people kind of calm down and get reasonable and moderate by censoring them. You make them get crazier, of course. That's ridiculous. LINDELL: Yes. You know, why wouldn't everyone want to know the truth of this country? Just let the truth be told. If there's nothing to hide, let's bring it out so we all can see it. Instead, they are trying to erase Mike Lindell and erase My Pillow. Well, I'm not going to be erased. I mean, all of these -- all my friends that lost their -- they lost their YouTube channels, they lost their Facebook, two million followers, one guy has 12 employees, he's gone. His livelihood he built up is just gone. Anybody -- any business and churches that supported the President, that's a whole another issue, they are being attacked and they're going to be just now canceled. CARLSON: No, I've noticed. Michael Lindell, I really appreciate your coming on tonight. Thank you very much. LINDELL: Well, thank you, Tucker. Thanks for having me on. And God bless you. Thank you. CARLSON: Amen. God bless you. Mike Lindell, he sells pillows. Why is he even censored? But by the way before you say, oh, it's Mike Lindell -- anyone who is censored has been wronged as an American. Period. And the censorship of any person diminishes the rest of us and diminishes this country. Period. It doesn't matter what they're saying. It doesn't matter whether you agree with them. In fact, if you disagree with them, you should argue more forcefully that their voice should be heard and then argue against the points they are making. Anyone who is been censored is welcome on this show as one of the last venues where you can speak for real anyone, whether they agree with you or not. Well, up next, a major court decision has just come down on Joe Biden's deportation order. It's a decision that completely upends that order. Pretty amazing news. We'll bring it to you in just a moment. CARLSON: Joe Biden's 100-day moratorium on deporting people, foreign nationals here illegally, will have massive consequences that most Americans have no understanding of. Last night on this show, former White House adviser, Stephen Miller outlined some of the implications. STEPHEN MILLER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE ADVISER: The 180,000 people that I.C.E. removed last year, those same 180,000 people could not be removed this year as a result of that deportation moratorium. Now, of those 180,000 people, Tucker, 92 percent of them are criminals, either charged or convicted of a crime. In this memo, there is no exceptions clause for criminals. So beginning in just a few days, about 12,000 criminals a month are going to be released into U.S. communities. CARLSON: Well, tonight, there has been a major court decision on this order from the administration. FOX's Rick Leventhal joins us now to explain exactly what it is. Hey, Rick. RICK LEVENTHAL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Tucker. As you've been reporting, President Biden's effort to remake immigration policy caused a lot of confusion with I.C.E. agents and officials and a Federal Judge in Texas is now blocking that pause for at least the next two weeks. The Judge's ruling is an early legal setback for the new administration, which hope to stop sending immigrants here illegally back over the border. U.S. District Judge Drew Tipton ruled on a challenge filed by the State of Texas, which argued it's a violation of Federal statutes and the Constitution to not enforce Federal law. The Judge criticized Biden's maneuver made on his first day in the Oval Office writing, "" ... the January 20 memorandum not only fails to consider potential policies more limited in scope and time, but it also fails to provide any concrete reasonable justification for a 100-day pause on deportations."" The Texas lawsuit argued any change in policy would require at least 180 days' notice and that the moratorium violates an existing agreement with the Department of Homeland Security. The judge found the pause could cause imminent and irreparable harm to Texas, but his ruling applies to the entire nation. In a statement, the White House says, it is confident the moratorium was quote, ""wholly appropriate, and it will prevail in court."" But for now, Tucker, arrests and deportations of people living illegally in the U.S. can continue -- Tucker. CARLSON: Amazing. Rick Leventhal for us tonight, thank you so much. LEVENTHAL: Sure. Well, as we mentioned a moment ago, the White House held several press briefings today about something called equity. It's not equality, its equity. According to Susan Rice, the Chief Domestic Policy adviser at the White House, enforcing equity will now be the primary mission of every agency in your Federal government. SUSAN RICE, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF DOMESTIC POLICY ADVISER: Every agency will place equity at the core of their public engagement, their policy design and program delivery to ensure that government resources are reaching Americans of color, and all marginalized communities. CARLSON: Now, we should be really clear, and we can't say this enough, because there's a rhetorical sleight of hand going on. Equity is not equality. Not everyone got that point. At one point, as he often does, Joe Biden forgot his line. He thought he was there to promote equality, you know, the principle this country was founded on. Fortunately, the new President caught his mistake very quickly. JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I believe this nation in this government need to change their whole approach to the issue of racial equality -- equity. That means we need to make the issue of racial equity, not just an issue for any one department of government, it has to be the business of the whole of government. Advancing equity has to be everyone's job. CARLSON: So you're 78, you spent your life using the word equality as Americans have for let's say, 250 years. It takes a while to figure out; now, we're talking about equity and the concepts have nothing to do with each other. In fact, they are opposites. Equity means dividing people according to categories they cannot control, ones they were born with, like the color of their skin or their sex. And according to Joe Biden, we need a whole lot more of that. Why? Because in May, a guy called George Floyd died. BIDEN: Those eight minutes and 46 seconds that took George Floyd's life opened the eyes of millions of Americans and millions of people around -- all over the world. It was the knee on the neck of justice. CARLSON: What you didn't realize when George Floyd died was equality was going away to be replaced with equity. What does that mean for the rest of us? Bob Woodson would know. He is a Civil Rights activist for more than 50 years. He founded the Woodson Center and we're happy to have him on tonight. Mr. Woodson, thank you for joining us. ROBERT WOODSON, FOUNDER, WOODSON CENTER: Thanks for having me, Tucker. CARLSON: If you wouldn't mind, as someone who has put the goal of equality at the center of his life for many decades, tell us what equity means? WOODSON: Equity, I mean, they are using inequality to both equity. Equity means if you're sitting at the gambling table, everybody gets the same winnings. So you don't have to win, you just -- you'll be given -- you'll be getting rewarded because you are who you are. You know, Tucker, this whole discussion of equity reminds me of a place -- a car that has four flat tires, and we argue over the race or sexual orientation of the driver. The system that -- CARLSON: That's good. WOODSON: It doesn't matter, you know, if the system is broken, and so there are several problems with it. Whenever you generalize about a group, all blacks, all gays, all women, and then you try to apply remedies for problems that that group has, it always benefits the elite at the expense of the ones at the bottom, always ends up being unequal. For example, they generalize about all women. And the #MeToo Movement was started when a woman in Harlem, I mean, in New York, tried to find a forum for abused, black, low-income black women to express themselves. Well, middle class, elite, black and white women sees that movement and then promoted, quote, ""equality for women,"" which meant that white rich and privileged black and white women were required to go on Boards of Directors and jobs and corporations. In the meantime, black women in prison, their needs were ignored. CARLSON: Yes. WOODSON: And whenever -- and so -- but they use and the conditions of low income women to promote remedies that does not help them. The other problem when you're looking at it through a racial prism, is that if evil wears a black face, it escapes detection and correction. For example, Geraldo Rivera did a two-hour documentary some years ago on sexual abuse of women in prison. Every one of the victims was black, every one of the victimizers was black. It did not generate any discussion of equality, because it didn't fit the racial narrative. CARLSON: Exactly. WOODSON: And that's the problem when we try to do that. And also what we do is we dumbed down standards. CARLSON: Well, we've been dumbed in fact. WOODSON: So -- CARLSON: No, I've certainly noticed that and it doesn't -- it doesn't help people at the bottom. I appreciate your coming on, Mr. Woodson. And of course, we'll see you again and I look forward to it. Thank you. WOODSON: All right. Thank you. CARLSON: So if you don't live in Washington, you might not know that there are still thousands of Federal troops in our nation's capital. What are they doing there exactly? Why aren't they leaving? What is this about? We'll investigate it after the break. PAMELA BROWN, CNN ANCHOR: Well, right now, plans are being made to keep thousands of National Guard troops in Washington at least through the end of the month, possibly into March. That's partly due to concerns about the upcoming impeachment proceedings, as well as other major political events that could attract violent fringe elements to the nation's capital. CARLSON: Thousands of soldiers are in our capital city, CNN is not curious about that at all, they are happy just to repeat the talking points. Oh, it's about -- who knows, but it's good for the country. Shut up. Stop asking questions. Is it good for the country? What is it about? Senator John Kennedy represents the State of Louisiana. He joins us tonight. Senator, I'm glad you came on tonight. I think this is a huge topic. It's being ignored by everybody. Why do we have thousands of soldiers in our capital city, seriously? SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA): Tucker, I'll have some things to account for on judgment day but one of them will not be being ungrateful for our National Guard and all law enforcement officials. God bless them. We had some nut jobs violate the Capitol on January 6. We brought in National Guard troops to ensure that President Biden had a safe inauguration. He did. Inauguration is over. But if you look around Capitol Hill, parts of it look like a scene from Mad Max. I mean, there's razor wire, there's fences, there are barricades. There are Humvees. There are automatic weapons; at one point, they had tanks. And the news media is always filming this stuff. If you ask our Democratic leadership, which is in charge, they don't tell you, well, we have all this here to keep you safe. I'm a pretty simple guy, Tucker. I like breakfast food and straight answers. And I'm not accusing anybody of anything. But Washington, D.C. being Washington, D.C., a cynic might think there's a political angle here. A cynical person might surmise that the Democratic leadership with the news media is trying to send a message to the American people and that message might be the Republicans couldn't keep you safe, but we, the Democrats can, which should cause you -- CARLSON: May I interrupt you -- may I interrupt you right there? KENNEDY: Sure. CARLSON: I spent my whole life in D.C., and the neighborhood where I spent my life, there are carjackings. There are police. No one is protecting the people of Washington. We had riots in the city. They burnt -- they tried to burn the oldest Episcopal Church in the city and no one did anything about it. I mean, this isn't protecting anybody except the people in power. I mean, truly. KENNEDY: Well, you're right. And the cynic who just might be seeing the message I just described, would also see the irony, because the Democrats want to defund the police. But the second message that the cynic might see is a message from the Uber elites and that message would be something along the lines of we, the Uber elites are very busy, important people. We're very smart. We're very virtuous. We have a second home with a long driveway and we're telling you, you need to be very, very afraid of anybody who didn't vote for Joe Biden and that's why we need to call in the National Guard. CARLSON: Yes. KENNEDY: Now, I'm not accusing -- I'm not accusing anybody of anything and I probably just blew any chance I ever had of having Katie Couric be a friend of mine on Facebook, but I think that's a legitimate point of view. CARLSON: I think it is, too, at least. Senator, it's great to see you tonight. Thank you for that. KENNEDY: Thank you. CARLSON: At some point, somebody in Congress needs to say, get your troops out of my city. Now. We learned this weekend that one of the top figures in the financial community sent more than $150 million to Jeffrey Epstein. Don't ask questions. It's totally normal, just like having thousands of troops in your capital is totally normal. What? Are you crazy? Maybe we are, because we're interested in why he did that and we'll get into it after the break. CARLSON: There was a major development over the weekend in the Jeffrey Epstein mystery because fundamentally, it is on the most basic level still a mystery. The development involves the CEO of Apollo Global Management. That's one of the top investment firms in the world. FOX's Matt Finn has been following the story and joins us tonight with an update. Hey, Matt. MATT FINN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Tucker, Apollo's former CEO, Leon Black, is stepping down after an investigation into his ties with Jeffrey Epstein revealed Black paid Epstein $158 million for fees related to tax and estate planning on Leon Black's yacht, but new details from a probe by an outside law firm insist there's no evidence that Black was involved in Epstein's crimes. Black even denied wrongdoing and condemned Epstein's conduct. But the Dechert law firm says it reviewed more than 60,000 documents, more than 20 witnesses were interviewed and portions of that investigation reads, quote, ""Epstein would at times allude to their personal relationship when attempting to negotiate aspects of their business relationship."" And ""Epstein made repeated efforts to ingratiate himself with other senior executives at Apollo. In the beginning of 2016, Black and Epstein's professional and personal relationship deteriorated over a payment dispute that had long been brewing with black refusing to pay Epstein tens of millions of dollars that Epstein believed he had earned."" The reports as Leon Black believed Epstein saved him up to $2 billion in taxes. Black asked for the outside review of their relationship -- Tucker. CARLSON: Matt Finn, thanks so much for that. Ghislaine Maxwell who is accused of sex trafficking minors on behalf of Jeffrey Epstein is still awaiting trial in this country, her lawyers are now trying to get the charges dropped in the name of -- wait for it -- equity. They are saying the grand jury was quote: ""Drawn from a community in which black and Hispanic residents are significantly underrepresented."" Okay. What does that mean by the way? Are black and Hispanic jurors more tolerant of this? Is that what you're saying? Because they're not. Tammy Bruce is the President the Independent Women's Voice. She joins us to assess. Now, Tammy, now, I know it is a conspiracy theory to suggest that the richest people in the world may be up to no good -- conspiracy theory. But what do you make of all these developments here? TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: Well, look, clearly, there are some very fabulous people who are fabulously rich, but what we do have here and the left and the right recognize it is an unfair dual system of justice, that of course, with enough money, you should be able to -- you get the best lawyers, you are able to drag the system along, you have friends in high places, that creates the inequality, right, in the system. And so when you're looking at someone like Ghislaine Maxwell, it is kind of shocking, I think it was shocking for Epstein that there was a little bit of attention paid to them and she is shocked. She is certainly not even out of prison, but I think there's a distraction there. This is really the tip of the iceberg. This kind of money that we're discussing is enormous and it really does have an impact on the nature of how the system deals with you. And I think this is what Americans don't like. But we've got to have more than gestures, right, than distractions in a certain way. Jeffrey Epstein and what they're doing with that kind of money, tens of millions, billions of dollars. There's questions, of course, about President Biden and the money from China when it comes to his son, and the amount of money that changes hands. Who has power and who does not? And then of course, when it comes to taxes, if you've got enough money, like Mr. Black, you're going to be able to hire someone to get you out of a tax framework. All taxes are meant for the little people. Let's never forget that. CARLSON: Yes. No, I think most of us are reminded of it quite a bit. Yes. Anyway, Tammy, great to see you tonight. Thank you so much. BRUCE: My pleasure. Thank you, dear. CARLSON: As we said at the beginning of the show, because we meant it, this is the free speech network. It always has been. What we didn't expect was to be the only one left. To protect speech, you can't be passive anymore. There is no option. You have to stand up for it or you'll lose it. FOX's Brit Hume joins us straight ahead. CARLSON: Freedom of speech is the foundational freedom, without it you don't have freedom. This network exists to defend the freedom of speech, it always has. I didn't think we'd be the only ones doing it. Few people understand the central importance of this right and the moment we're in like Brit Hume. He is our senior political analyst here on FOX, we're happy to have him with us tonight. Brit, you spent your life benefiting from the First Amendment. What do you think of what you're watching now? BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, what's most distressing to me, Tucker, about this period of time where you get all kinds of crackdowns on speech and different news organizations and so forth is the extent to which journalists themselves are now participating in it. We're hearing this from a number of journalistic quarters and it astounds me, frankly, because I don't know that there's any chance that these efforts to shut down this channel and various other outlets will succeed. I suspect, they may not. However, it is alarming. And it suggests to me, Tucker, that the people who are calling for this stuff don't really understand the basis of our concept of free speech, which is that our people are better informed by hearing a wide range of voices and tolerating them and that the answer to objectionable speech is not censorship. Thomas Jefferson actually expressed this very well many years back when he said the following, ""For here,"" he said, ""We're not afraid to follow truth wherever it may lead, nor to tolerate any error, so long as reason is left free to combat it."" That's the concept. Open forums, free speech. If you find speech objectionable, respond to it with something better. Later on, later in 1927, there is a famous case called Whitney versus California in which Justice Brandeis had a famous passage, and he is talking about this very issue. He said, ""If there be time to expose through discussion the falsehood and fallacies,"" he said, "" ... to avert the evil by the process of education, the remedy to be implied is more speech, not enforced silence."" What we're hearing and seeing now is journalists themselves trying to shut down other news organizations and channels and I find it astonishing and alarming. CARLSON: I just never thought I would live in a moment where you and I were nodding enthusiastically about Justice Brandeis. But we are and for good reason. Brit Hume, great to see you tonight. Thank you for that. HUME: Yes. Thank you, Tucker. You bet. CARLSON: We'll be back tomorrow night and every weeknight to the show that is the sworn enemy of lying pomposity, smugness and groupthink. We're happy you joined us tonight. We'll see you tomorrow. Sean Hannity right now. Classification"
2021-01-28,"TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. Quite a day in financial markets, not a phrase we use a lot on this show, but a lot happened today and there are massive implications for all of us. Dave Portnoy joins us in a moment to explain what those are, but first some context of what we're watching right now. Last March, as the country began to panic about the arrival of a strange new coronavirus from China, a billionaire called Bill Ackman went on television in an attempt to make America even more afraid than it already was. ""Our economy may be done at this point,"" he said, over, dead, not coming back. Bill Ackman went on like this for 28 full minutes, terrified CNBC viewers watched slack jawed as he ranted. Here's part of his performance. BILL ACKMAN, CEO, PERSHING SQUARE CAPITAL: Hell is coming. This was a feeling like I've never had, like there's a tsunami coming, right? The tsunami is coming in and you feel it in the air, right? The tide starts to roll out. Okay. And on the beach, people are playing and having fun, like there's nothing going on. And that is the feeling I've had for the last two months. Okay. And my colleagues at work, okay, thought I was a lunatic. We need to shut it down now. America will end as we know it, okay, I'm sorry to say so. Okay, unless we take this option. CARLSON: Bill Ackman was afraid, and he wanted you to be afraid. Ackman was especially frightened for the future of Hilton Hotels. Hilton Hotels, Ackman proclaimed quote: ""Is going to zero along with every other hotel company in the world."" Every hotel is going to be shut down in the country -- everyone. Talk about scary. But in the end, not for Bill Ackman. Not long after that appearance, we learned that Ackman's firm had made more than $2 billion from trading in the stocks that many people believed he had pushed down with the hysterically dire predictions you just saw, including Hilton Hotels. So, it was Ackman's rant on CNBC part of a very dishonest investment strategy? It seemed pretty obvious, so we said so on the air. Ackman's lawyers immediately threatened to sue us. In a long phone conversation later, Ackman swore to us that his public attack on Hilton Hotels had nothing at all to do with his desire to buy hotel stocks at a lower price or with the billions in profit that his firm subsequently reported. There was no connection whatsoever he promised, and he sounded emotional as he said it. We will let you assess Bill Ackman's sincerity. We do know that this kind of behavior is common on Wall Street. Ackman himself wants to attack the company Herbalife on television, it's going to zero he once again predicted in an effort to profit from Herbalife's decline, pretty ugly. But that kind of thing happens a lot on Wall Street. Hedge fund managers bet money that a specific stock will decline in value. That's called short selling. Short selling has no obvious value to the American economy. Short selling exists for the purpose of enriching the people who do it. Short selling hurts companies, obviously, it hurts their investors, it hurts their employees, ultimately, it hurts our country itself. Yet it continues. No one does anything about short selling. Regulators ignore it. CNBC applauds the brilliance of the people who do it. Oh, they're so clever, those hedge fund managers. In fact, NBC's business regularly lends its airwaves to unscrupulous short sellers who use free TV airtime -- you may have seen this -- to tank American companies for profit. They do that all the time. The last administration did nothing to stop this. The current administration certainly won't. The Biden White House is more tightly controlled by business interests than any administration in history. Virtually every person there is beholden to the finance establishment. What's happening on Wall Street is so clearly awful and so obviously destructive, the question is, who is going to fight back against it? As it turns out, a bunch of guys on Reddit will. It fell to them to push back against the short sellers because no one else even tried, so they did. A group of independent investors in a Reddit group called Wall Street Bets learned that hedge funds planned to short the stock of a fading retail company called GameStop. So the Reddit investors began buying shares of GameStop. GameStop surged in value ultimately up by more than a thousand percent. The hedge funds, for all their calculation hadn't seen that coming and they lost billions as a result of it. One hedge fund lost so much money it needed a bailout from two other hedge funds. Meanwhile, some of the investors on Reddit got rich, but getting rich was not the whole reason they did it. They also wanted to send a message for the hedge fund managers. Here is one of the Reddit guys, a man called Justin Speak, explaining. JUSTIN SPEAK, REDDIT USER: I'd be lying to say if there wasn't some pleasure out of the fact -- you know, I'm a pastor and Jesus tells a story about this rich fool who has an over abundant harvest that's more than he can store, and rather than give the excess to those in need, he chooses to build bigger and bigger barns to store it for himself. And rather than share the billions with the less fortunate, they've built bigger and bigger barns for themselves. And so yes, as a hundred percent, there is a part of me that thought, well, it will be fun to be a part of this moment to see this moment where at some level overnight, these investors are losing their investing lies that's being demanded from them, and they're left wondering what -- who is going to get what they had prepared for themselves. CARLSON: ""They've built bigger barns for themselves."" Well, that's true, not to mention epically enormous art collections. The hedge fund people in case you haven't noticed, in case you don't read the business press are very proud of their art collections very, aggressively, flamboyantly proud, despite the fact that a lot of their so called art is ugly, overpriced garbage, cheap, garish crap that people will laugh at a generation from now, and that tells you a lot. It turns out that a lot of our financial wizards have awful taste, as vulgar as the way they do business. They don't know that though, because no one dares tell them in a country that worships finance people. They're the kind of rich people who still think Frank Gehry is a brilliant architect, not a scam artist. So people like that -- arrogant, lacking any self-awareness whatsoever, understandably generates some resentment from the rest of the population. They pause and say, wait a second, Bill Ackman and the many people on Wall Street who behave like Bill Ackman, what exactly did you do to make $2 billion? Did you improve anything? Was it just another sleazy inside deal that the rest of us were excluded from participating in? Tell us now. Please speak slowly so we can understand your answer. That was pretty much the message the Reddit guys were sending to Wall Street. Watching at home, a lot of Americans applauded that message. They feel the same way. But the hedge people don't, they were unhappy. People who lose money rarely are happy. But here's what makes the hedge fund managers different from you. They have a lot more power than you. They control the game, so they immediately changed the rules of the game. Today, the investment app Robin Hood, which is used by independent investors to buy and sell stock, banned its users from trading GameStop shares, as well as from several other company shares. No one even knew that was legal. Maybe it isn't. But Robin Hood did it anyway, and they did it under pressure from the hedge funds, who they really work for. So much for the free market you're always hearing about, there's nothing free about it. That turned out to be a lie. It turns out that what Wall Street really hates is outsider trading. The idea that people from outside their world might be getting rich, that's the one sin they can abide. The management of Robin Hood, of course didn't admit any of this, they can't. They're still posing instead, as an outpost of inclusive progressive values in a sea of rapacious capitalism, the irony being, of course, Robin Hood is the most rapacious. They sell information they gather from their customers to the hedge funds who use it for their advantage and most customers don't even know. How's that for progressive? On the other hand, they do support BLM. They are against hate and systemic racism. They're for science, and they want you to know that. Here's an ad from Robin Hood that ran just last month.  ANNOUNCER (voice-over): Remember, when greed was good? When you had to look the part, when you had to pay for a seat at the table. We set out to change the way the system works, to put the power in everyone's hands, to make it feel, speak, sound and look just like you. We all invest every day in ourselves, our communities, our future. We are all investors. CARLSON: It is so to watch that stuff after the fact. That ran a month ago, ""We set out to change the way the system works,"" says Robin Hood. Well, that's for sure. In fact, that's literally true. Robin Hood changed the system at precisely the moment when people from outside the system started benefiting from the system. Sorry, proles. No trading for you. We are locking your account. Other platforms took effectively the same position but felt the need to pretend a little more than Robin Hood did. They justified changing the rules by attacking the very people they were hurting by changing the rules. The communication service, Discord for example, banned users from the Wall Street Bets group from using its platform. Why did they do that? It wasn't all because the Reddit guys were beating the hedge fund guys at their own grubby game and that's not allowed. No, it had nothing to do with that, of course. No, instead, they were banned according to Discord because the Reddit guys had engaged in quote, ""hate speech."" Of course, the Reddit guys were racists. That's when they humiliated the hedge funds. Only a racist would do that. You can laugh if you want, but keep in mind, this is a time-tested tactic. It works. That's why they do it. Remember back if you can to the Occupy Wall Street protests of more than a decade ago. The 2008 crash wrecked an awful lot of families in this country, many have not recovered even now. People are angry about that and many blamed Wall Street and they said so. But rather than address their grievances, some of them legitimate, Wall Street and its countless puppets in the media just changed the subject. So, it was right about this point that we started hearing an awful lot about identity politics. We can prove that. In 2011, when the Occupy Movement was at its peak, mentions of the word ""racism"" in ""The New York Times"" and ""The Washington Post"" and ""Los Angeles Times"" skyrocketed. In the case of ""The Washington Post,"" which is America's most committed defender of entrenched power, literally owned now by the richest man in the world, mentions of racism nearly tripled at the height of Occupy Wall Street. Oh, and of course it worked. They changed the subject. They're doing that again. They always do that. Always. Over in CNBC, home of the professional short seller, the ones who tell you to sell when they profit from it, they haven't started yet yelling about the scourge of white supremacy on Reddit, though, obviously, that's coming. It's inevitable. But they started their defense of big finance a little more tactfully than that. The problem with humiliating hedge funds explained anchor and professional hedge fund shill, Andrew Ross Sorkin is that, in the end, humiliating hedge funds only hurts the people who do it. So, for their own good, they don't want to stop this nonsense immediately. ANDREW ROSS SORKIN, CNBC ANCHOR: What I'm concerned about is that this is a pump and dump scheme that effectively is being cloaked, you know, as Mother Teresa has arrived on the scene. I think there are real underlying issues with the system that need to be resolved. I do not want to protect the system. I love watching the little guy beat the big guy as much as anybody, but what I wonder is whether these folks trying to quote-unquote ""stick it to the man"" are ultimately going to be sticking it to themselves. CARLSON: They only hurt themselves with their scheme. Not at all like what the guests on this do. This is a scheme. And Andrew Ross Sorkin is deeply concerned about this scheme. He's just really, really worried that average people might be hurt by this scheme. He can barely sleep thinking about it. He was so fraught with anxiety last night. He was almost late to SoulCycle this morning. That's how much he tossed in turned beneath his Goose Down Duvet as he pondered the fate of America's beleaguered middle class, which is hilarious. But even if you were to believe it, it's a little late, honestly. Where was Andrew Ross Sorkin for the last dozen years as the Central Bank shoveled trillions to Wall Street, thereby enriching a few devaluing the American dollar, guaranteeing hyperinflation, and of course, destroying the value of the average person's savings? Did Andrew Ross Sorkin even notice that any of that happened? The Reddit guys noticed that's why they're mad. Janet Yellen might have something interesting to say about all of this. Janet Yellen ran the Federal Reserve for years beginning under Barack Obama. As much as any single person on earth, Janet Yellen is responsible for creating the distorted financial system that made the Reddit revolt possible, indeed inevitable. So where is Janet Yellen now? And what does she have to say for herself? Oh, yes, as of last week, Janet Yellen is Joe Biden's Treasury Secretary. Here's what Joe Biden's fleck had to say yesterday about Janet Yellen. QUESTION: Is the White House concerned about the stock market activity we're seeing around GameStop? And now with some other stocks as well, including the subsidiaries or whatever the company that was Blockbuster. And have there been any conversations with the S.E.C. about how to proceed? JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Well, I'm also happy to repeat that we have the first female Treasury Secretary and a team that's surrounding her and often, questions about the market, we will send to them, but our team is, of course, our economic team, including Secretary Yellen and others are monitoring the situation. It's a good reminder, though, that the stock market isn't the only measure of the health of our economy. It doesn't reflect how working in middle class families are doing. CARLSON: So, as her first answer, Jen Psaki is, quote, ""happy to repeat the Janet Yellen is the first female Treasury Secretary."" Let's translate. Actually, Janet Yellen has nothing to say about Reddit or GameStop or short selling or even the dangerously corrupt condition of American Finance more broadly. She hasn't thought about those things, probably doesn't even care. Janet Yellen herself has made millions from hedge funds, including from funds that lost money to the Reddit guys, but whatever. Buzz off. We'd like to remind you that Janet Yellen is a woman and so are many of the people around her. These brave leaders have broken glass ceilings. They are empowered and that's enough. We can't give you an answer. We won't improve your life. But we do have diversity so you should be happy. That's their position. Has there ever in all human history, a clear distillation of the essence of neoliberalism than that? Probably there never has been. Maybe at this point people will start to catch on to the game. Suddenly, people are catching on to a lot of things it looks like. Looking back, we may see the Reddit guys and their effective defense of GameStop as a kind of turning point in this country's history. Whatever our current system is, it is definitely not the capitalism we were promised, not even close. One of the rare people in media who understands this is our next guest. He is the founder of Barstool Sports, as well as an independent investor who trades an awful lot online and has done well. Dave Portnoy joins us now to explain exactly what this moment means. Dave, this kind of gets to the heart of what you've been doing under quarantine, and I'm wondering what lessons we can draw from this? What is happening exactly? DAVE PORTNOY, FOUNDER, BARSTOOL SPORTS: You know, I've been trading heavily since the quarantine started, I was shocked by this. I personally did invest in AMC and Nokia. Those are two of the stocks that the Reddit guys and Wall Street Bets guys were pushing, I believed in the power of the internet. When I saw what the Robin Hood was doing, ironically, Robin Hood take from, you know, take from the rich and give to the poor, even though they do the exact opposite. I was stunned. I think it's criminal. I think there has to be an investigation. I think people have to go to jail. Whether that actually happens, I don't know, but I've never been more convinced about market manipulation and the people, the hedge funds controlling the game, than today. I mean, just wake up and say, hey, you can't trade these stocks anymore. You can only sell them. We are going to intentionally crash the market in these stocks. And everyone who has it, tough, you're going to lose a ton of money. But we're going to save the rich people and the hedge funds. Shocking, like in 20 years of me doing Barstool, I'm not exaggerating. It's the most shocked I've been, and maybe I shouldn't be. But you know, when you have AOC and Donald Trump Jr., both on the same side of an issue, you know, something is dramatically wrong. CARLSON: This seems like a betrayal of the basic promise of American public markets, which is their transparency is purely meritocratic, I mean, that's what you've been able to make dough during quarantine. You make a bet, you're right, you win. I mean, how amazing is it to discover that that's not real. PORTNOY: Apparently, it's real for them. And I love the lectures. You hear it from the hedge funds and the suits, as I call them, but they'll say they're protecting you, and we're protecting you versus yourself and people don't understand the risk and margin. And then you'll look at it and it is like, buddy, look in the mirror, you're doing the same thing. The hedge funds are betting against companies, we're betting on them with money and margin. We're doing the same thing. The only difference is we're winning, and you're getting your teeth kicked in. And you just said timeout, we're changing the rules. And it's bananas. It cannot happen. I saw the Robin Hood guy vlog, he's on TV, he is lying through his teeth. There is -- listen, the thing that really is scary, Robin Hood, I'm going to give this guy a shred of credit. When he woke up and he said we're going to halt trading and ruin our client base, he knew that was the end of Robin Hood. Robin Hood is done. That company will cease to exist because what they built it on the day trader, the retail trader, they're never going back. So he willingly blew up his company today. He knew that was going to happen. Why? Who is in the back end? Who is pulling the strings? Who is making the decisions? We have to find out. And by the way, it's not enough just to be like, oh, we're going to slap you on the wrist and give you a fine. These are billionaires. They can write billion-dollar checks like we write $10.00 checks. Somebody has to go to jail for this. This is intentional market manipulation. And it is everyday people's, just not the Reddit people. I have people hit me up all the time. Today and yesterday, they're putting their rent into this. They got caught up in the momentum. And if you lose money, fair and square, fine; but nobody was under the impression somebody could just press the stop button and say, guess what? We can crash this stock without you having any say. You can only sell it. You can't buy it. What happened? This is like the movie ""Wall Street."" It's insane. CARLSON: I just read a piece about 15 minutes ago that said, and it seemed right that Robin Hood's real customer is not retail investors like you, its real customer is the hedge funds. They sell data on trades to the hedge funds, which use it to their advantage. Assuming that's true, did you know that? Do you think Robin Hood knew that? PORTNOY: I didn't know that. I did not know that until today. I don't think anybody knew a lot of the things that were going on until today. You know, again, Robin Hood was operating under the guise that this was a retail trading platform. A lot of people said I helped build it because we had all our retail bros as they call them going there. They literally in their bio said they're going to democratize trading. It's the exact opposite. And now they're saying we're going to go back to normal tomorrow. We're going to let everybody do our normal trading tomorrow. Well, Tucker, what changed? Oh, I'll tell you what changed. The billionaire hedge funds, they got out of their shorts tonight. So why is this behavior not risky tomorrow, but it was today? It's because they're being pulled by strings. It's criminal behavior what happened today. Plain and simple, people have to go to jail. Plain and simple. CARLSON: Best description I've heard. I've got to ask you before you go, several weeks ago, you announced you're starting this fund to help businesses, a lot of restaurants that were hurt by the corona shutdowns. You're starting to raise money. How much did you raise? And how is it going? PORTNOY: We are closing in on $33 million raised, over 200 businesses we've helped. We have over 200,000 people who have donated to it. And it's a -- you know, again, I'm a prickly guy. But it's been -- it's been gratifying to be able to help and thank you to everybody who has donated. We continue to do it. But we're helping a lot of small businesses and a lot of employees and a lot of communities. So, it actually -- it's been -- it's been great. It really has. CARLSON: It's amazing. You're like your own Federal agency at this point. Helping people when others won't. I appreciate it. Dave Portnoy, thank you for coming on tonight. PORTNOY: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: So, amidst all the turmoil, there's an actual power struggle, but it's more than that. It's a struggle over ideas, over ideology, over philosophy going on at the very center of the Republican Party. You should know about it because it'll help define what the party is going forward. Congressman Matt Gaetz is in Wyoming tonight. We'll tell you why because he's involved in that struggle. Plus, teachers unions have decided they don't want to teach your children. Last night, we showed you a poignant and moving video of one parent who confronted his School Board about it. BRANDON MICHON, PARENT: The garbage workers who pick up my freaking trash risk their lives every day, more than anyone in this school system. CARLSON: That man joins us straight ahead. CARLSON: We're in a new era, obviously. And among the many realignments taking place in American life, we just spent 25 minutes telling you about the one going on Wall Street tonight. There is also a struggle underway -- quite an intense one -- over what the Republican Party represents going forward. There are a lot of people involved in this. We want to single out two who represent poles in the party -- opposite ends. One is Congresswoman Liz Cheney of Wyoming. That states only Member of Congress, who is a neoconservative, represents the older Republican Party back during the Bush years, probably more precisely. At the other end is Congressman Matt Gaetz of Florida with a very different outlook. The question is how much power in the new Republican Party will Liz Cheney have? Well, today, Congressman Matt Gaetz traveled to the State of Wyoming, went outside the state capitol there joined by hundreds of protesters who do not believe that Liz Cheney should be one of the people running the Republican Party going forward. What is this about exactly? Congressman Matt Gaetz joins us tonight to explain. Congressman, thanks so much for coming on. And I just want to say at the outset, that this is not anything against Liz Cheney personally. I know Liz Cheney. I like Liz Cheney. I think she is smart. It's not personal. It's philosophical. And I guess the question is, how is someone who is so closely aligned with say, Bill Kristol, a very sinister person and many other neocons who have so much hurt this country. How is that person so close to the top of the leadership of the Republican Party tonight? REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): Well, because inside the beltway of Washington, D.C., the establishment has concentrated their power. And now they want to be able to reconstitute the Republican Party in their image. My theory of the case, Tucker is that if we only fight the neocons in Washington, D.C., then they're on their home turf. So, I think we need to go out into the country, we need to inspire a positive populism. And we need to stand against these America last politicians who are a lot like Congress as a whole, owned by foreign interests abroad, special interests at home, and then at times deeply unpopular. I saw a poll that came out yesterday that had Liz Cheney at 10 percent approval rating with Republicans in her own state. Now, by contrast, Muammar Gaddafi had a 13 percent approval rating and his final days. And so it's a bit ironic that Liz Cheney is less popular among Republicans than the Arab dictators that she wants to throw out of office. CARLSON: So, here's the confusing part. And again, it's not personal, it's philosophical. But if you were to poll Republican voters on their belief, they would come much closer to yours than to the beliefs of Liz Cheney and Bill Kristol. So why would Kevin McCarthy, the leader of Republicans in the House back Liz Cheney? A sincere question. GAETZ: Well, of course to be able to maintain power, Tucker. I don't think that there's any love lost between Kevin McCarthy and Liz Cheney, but if you're a member of the establishment and the leadership, the most dangerous concept in the world to you is that anyone in the leadership could be removed by virtue of a vote of the membership. Kevin McCarthy needs to hold a vote on Liz Cheney and if he doesn't, the Republican conference is a total joke. More than half of the Republican Conference has said that this person does not speak for us. Now you and I both know, the Republicans basically have no power in Washington, D.C. right now. The only power we have is to communicate and if the person we've designated to communicate for us as the Conference Chair doesn't have the support of the majority of the conference, it is a total fiction that you've created regarding the entire structure of leadership. CARLSON: Interesting, I mean, now that we're all defending democracy, a vote seems like a good idea since voting is democracy. So, I hope you get one. Matt Gaetz, I appreciate it. Thank you. GAETZ: Thank you, Tucker. CARLSON: Well, the total number of coronavirus deaths used to be a huge deal at CNN. They had at one time a coronavirus death tracker. We are learning tonight that the number of coronavirus deaths is very different from what we have been led by politicians to believe, very different, especially in one state. We will tell you where, next. CARLSON: We showed you tape last night of a parent who speaks for so many parents of school aged children in this country right now. His name is Brandon Michon. He's from Northern Virginia. Here's what he told the school board in his County. MICHON: You think you're some sort of martyrs because of the decisions you're making when the statistics do not lie that the vast majority of the population is not at risk from this virus. CARLSON: They should be working, they are not. We'll speak to the man who said that in just a moment. But first, it's not very often that politicians show signs of self- awareness, self-reflection, but on Tuesday, we did see one of those moments. It came from New York's Emmy Award winning Governor Andrew Cuomo. Now according to Andrew Cuomo, the government that Andrew Cuomo runs is totally incompetent. GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): Incompetent government kills people. Incompetent government kills people. More people died than needed to die in COVID. That's the truth. CARLSON: He said it twice, so he means it or maybe he was just trying to get the attention of the anchor. Either way, he is right. A new report from the New York Attorney General's Office confirms Andrew Cuomo assessment of Andrew Cuomo. In fact, according to that report, Andrew Cuomo's government has been undercounting nursing home deaths from COVID by up to 50 percent. Jeanine Pirro is the host of ""Justice with Judge Jeanine"" on the FOX News. We're happy to have her on tonight. Fifty percent undercount of deaths. What? JEANINE PIRRO, FOX NEWS HOST, ""JUSTICE WITH JUDGE JEANINE"": Well, you know, Tucker, it's worse than we thought. We know that Andrew Cuomo wasn't responding, we knew that he wasn't being transparent. But to find out that the deaths are 50 percent under reported is absolutely an unbelievable shock. He was not being transparent. He would not answer questions by anyone. And here you've got this governor who is promoting himself all during this pandemic, you know, with his brother frayed on CNN, they have the Cuomo brothers show laughing and talking about how great they are. He writes a book on leadership about himself in the middle of the pandemic and how he is really handling this pandemic so well, I mean, you know, think about it. What leader -- what great leader do you know who during a war or a pandemic says, you know, I'm so great, I'm handling this, and I happen to know he's a bit shady. I ran against him a long time ago. But the truth is that he was the one who was sending COVID infected patients into nursing homes and that is what caused the number of deaths to skyrocket. You don't have to -- you don't have to be a genius to figure that out. And then when he was questioned about: why are you sending COVID infected patients into nursing homes? He blamed it on Donald Trump. Meanwhile, Donald Trump was the one who was giving on all the help he needed, you know, and giving him whatever he asked for, and he thanked him in March and April and May and then all of a sudden now everything is Donald Trump's fault. You've got Andrew Cuomo who is ridiculing people, who have loved ones who are dying in these nursing homes like our own Janice Dean, making fun of them. And you know, at the same time, he wins an Emmy for being such a great guy. You've got to give credit to the left. But here's where the trouble comes in. It's a cover up, Tucker. It was a cover up when he undercut the numbers by half, and it may even be more than that, okay. And number two, he then makes the decision to give immunity to nursing homes and hospital administrators in a law that he signs shortly thereafter, so that they cannot be sued civilly or criminally. Even the Attorney General says that that should be changed. To me that's consciousness of guilt. Here is this guy who is doing it intentionally, sending them in, blaming Cuomo all the time being asked about: why are you doing it? Not answering the question, engaging in an ego trip and now what he's saying is, you know, nobody is going to be prosecuted. Don't worry about it. I've got you all covered. I passed the law. This guy is the essence of corruption. He is mean spirited. He is evil and what he did, by the way, New York is the epicenter of the coronavirus. We've got more deaths in this state than any other state in the country and he wants to talk about what a wonderful guy he is. CARLSON: Jeanine Pirro, I appreciate that assessment. Good to see you tonight. Thank you. PIRRO: Thank you. CARLSON: We showed you the tape last night. It moved a lot of people. Brandon Michon is a parent in Loudoun County, Virginia. This week, he confronted the teachers unions that are refusing to go back and teach his children. MICHON: You're a bunch of cowards, hiding behind our children, as an excuse for keeping schools closed. Figure it out or get off the podium. Because you know what? There are people like me and a lot of other people out there who will gladly take your seat and figure it out. CARLSON: Brandon Michon joins us tonight. Brandon, thanks so much for coming on. Boy, that really got a lot of people including me -- why did you do that? What moved you to do that? MICHON: Look, we've gone for months to the School Board meetings, and as parents, you know, our voice wasn't being heard. What you didn't see in that video was my five-year-old and eight-year-old speaking. And after they spoke, there was no acknowledgement of that. You have School Board members who are trying to, you know, just move you on to the next thing and there's no acknowledgement. It's scary to talk in front of these people. It is scary for us to even do it. CARLSON: Yes. MICHON: And so what happened was, when I got up there, you know, my blood started blowing a little bit. And as I began speaking, I said, look, I want them to hear me, and I wanted them to look up and pay attention and I think we've got some acknowledgement from that. CARLSON: I bet you did it. You certainly woke up a lot of the country. The camera shot is static. We don't see their reactions. What were their reactions? MICHON: You know, I think it was a little bit of awe, right? You know, there's a decorum that they want. And I wasn't fitting that, but you know, to take a step back, this is about the children. This isn't about a political party. CARLSON: Yes. MICHON: You know, the teachers themselves, they're -- you know, they're trying their best. They were thrown in these circumstances, and I feel for them. Look, a kindergarten teacher never signed up to be an online professor, and so, we're all trying to figure this out together, children, and teachers. What we want is them back in schools learning and being children. CARLSON: And every parent who has watched, you know, kids languish for the last year, I think feels the way that you do. Do you think that the administrators or the union leaders understand this now? MICHON: You know, look, we have elected officials, we bring them in. They're supposed to have a job to do. A lot of times, it's easy to sit back and let other people lead. What I said, and what I was passionate about is, look, if you're not going to lead, this country was built on strong leaders, take a step to the side, that's okay, and let other people step into that void. And if you're not going to get our kids back, make a plan and execute it. And you know what? You may fall a little short, but it's better than no plan at all. And you know, the key thing I think is like, you've got to put something -- put something out there and take a little bit of risk. CARLSON: This country was built on strong leaders. Boy, that is such a wise observation. No leadership is almost worse than making, you know, wrong decisions and then correcting them. Do you see anybody in your state or your county or town stepping forward to provide that leadership? MICHON: Look, I think there's a lot of parents and look, I'm just a father, right? I have kids, and I want the best for them. But there's so many others who just want the best for their kids. There's a lot of people have reached out to me from across the country, ironically, saying thank you for being a voice. And the only thing I can really say is, as citizens, we vote, we speak, and we can make change. And so, go to your local School Board meeting, look it up, see what it is. Go and see. Write something, you know, phone in, write an e-mail, try to make some change, try to get our kids back in school because our kids are the most important asset in our life, and them learning and being mentored and being educated is all we have to look forward to because they're going to be taking care of us when we're old. CARLSON: I've got to ask. I don't know the answer to this. What do you do for a living? And what does your employer think of this? MICHON: I don't really want to get into that. This isn't about that. CARLSON: No, I get it. MICHON: This is about the children. Right? My colleagues have an understanding. This has nothing to do with me. This is my side, in my view that children should be educated in a certain way and give them the optionality, right? If some parents want to keep their kids at home. That is great. If some parents want to put their kids in school, give them that option as well. But kids need to be kids and parents need to let them grow and let the educators and the teachers who want to be there with them either virtually or in person, give them that option and get us back to some normalcy. CARLSON: Yes, that is not a political point. That's the truth. And I hope you are celebrated and not punished for making it. I appreciate your coming on. Brandon, thank you. MICHON: Thank you so much. Appreciate it. CARLSON: So, what you've seen with the Reddit investors in GameStop isn't just a news story. It has profound implications for this country and this economy. What are those implications? Glenn Greenwald has been watching this carefully and has a really interesting answer. He'll be joining us after the break. PORTNOY: Look in the mirror, you're doing the same thing. The hedge funds are betting against companies. We're betting on them with money and margin. We're doing the same thing. The only difference is we're winning and you're getting your teeth kicked in. It's because they're being pulled by strings. It's criminal behavior what happened today. Plain and simple, people have to go to jail. CARLSON: That, as you know, was earlier in the show. Dave Portnoy who runs the sports site Barstool, some of the smartest analysis on what we're seeing on Wall Street now from a guy with a sports site. One of the smartest pieces written on this today came from someone who was also not strictly speaking a financial journalist. He covers politics and foreign policy. He is Glenn Greenwald. He's an independent journalist, you can find his work on ""Substack."" We hope you support it. And we are grateful to have on tonight to explain what this means. You wrote a great piece on this today, Glenn, there's so much to say. But how would you assess what we're seeing with GameStop and the hedge funds? GLENN GREENWALD, JOURNALIST: There are a whole bunch of different power centers in the United States, many of which we often openly discuss: the Intelligence community, Silicon Valley, the U.S. government, lobbyists, obviously one of the most important and powerful, if not the most powerful is Wall Street and hedge funds, in particular on Wall Street who are at the top of that food chain and we almost never talk about how it is that they get to be multibillionaires without really producing anything of value, just leeching off the American economy taking huge amounts of money in exchange for nothing. Whatever you think of Silicon Valley, they get rich at least by producing something, whatever you think of those products. CARLSON: Totally agree. GREENWALD: These people produce nothing. They just take and they just take, and they take. And so for the first time, not only are we seeing them have pain inflicted on them, not by people who are stealing from them or who are committing crimes, but people who have figured out their game and learned how to exploit it by doing what they should do, which is be studying it. But they are also getting dragged out into the sunlight. So for the first time, we're talking about people like Melvin Capital and Citadel and hedge fund short sellers and understanding what it is that they're doing to this country and it only happened, Tucker, because the internet, a free internet, when it's free, enables citizens to band together in large enough numbers to challenge these ruling class elites and that's why we talk so much about the imperative nature of defending the internet from surveillance, defending it from censorship, it is a very powerful weapon in the hands of citizens against ruling class elites. And that's why they're so bent upon seizing it back, controlling it, regulating it and censoring it. CARLSON: I think you make such a wise point, if I made a billion dollars, people would say where did you make a billion dollars? And for what? And I would feel incumbent upon me, the responsibility to explain what I did. I never hear anybody discuss what the upper echelons of finance have really done or as you point out, contributed to become billionaires. Like why is that not a conversation we're having all the time? GREENWALD: Right. And the other thing that I think is so interesting in this particular case, is you see people on the left and people on the right reacting in very similar ways, namely, in favor of what these Redditors did to these hedge funds. Why? Because if you're on the right, what you believe in, generally, traditionally, is free market economics. CARLSON: Right. GREENWALD: If you're on the left, what you believe in is government intervention in the economy to help the neediest. We have neither of those. What we have is a totally rigged system where the government constantly intervenes in the economy, but not to help people who are in need, but to help the richest and most powerful who are funded and owned and controlled by those very rich people who fund their campaigns, who pay their lobbyists, who give them enormous speaking fees when they're out of power. And it's a system that no one either on the left or the right supports. The only people who support it are these establishment centrist in both wings of the parties, and they see these people uniting against them, and that's why they're desperate to re-impose a wedge between us so that we can't unite anymore. CARLSON: But there's a realignment coming, which is the good news, the great Glenn Greenwald. Thank you. We'll be right back. CARLSON: That's it for us. We appreciate your spending the hour watching this show. You may not agree with everything we say or think, but the one thing you can be certain of, we're saying what we really believe because we can. This is the free speech, the last one left in American media. We will rejoin you tomorrow night, 8:00 p.m., the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. Sean Hannity takes over from here. Classification"
2021-01-07,"TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. So much going on, but first, a skeletal outline of the news. So yesterday, President Trump told a group of his supporters to head to the U.S. Capitol Building, many of them did. While they were there, some of Trump's supporters pushed over police barricades, crawled through broken windows and made a mess inside. One of the protesters, a woman from San Diego who was wearing a Donald Trump flag as a cape was shot dead by police. Within minutes of all of this, virtually every powerful person in the country erupted in rage at Donald Trump. Business Leaders demanded that Trump be removed from office immediately under the 25th Amendment. Members of Congress clamor to impeach Donald Trump. At least one Democrat suggested that anyone in Congress who supported Donald Trump's claims of election fraud must be expelled. Meanwhile, the media set about denouncing Donald Trump as a terrorist and a murderer, et cetera, we could go on. But that's a rough recap of the last 24 hours. What do you notice about every news story on that list? They're all about Donald Trump, every one of them. The people in charge of every institution in American life now spend all day talking about Donald Trump. You may not have noticed, because that's not very different from any other day over the past five years. Since the moment he announced for office, it has been all about Donald Trump all of the time, and the effect on us has been noticed. We've gone from being this big, sprawling continental country with an enormous span of concerns and interests, to kind of sweaty, airless chat room of 330 million people, all of whom are simultaneously focused with monomaniacal intensity on a single man -- Donald Trump. That is not healthy, no matter how you feel about Trump. And by the way, we're not attacking him. Very few media outlets have been more supportive of Donald Trump's 2016 agenda than this show has been. We agreed with his ideas then, we agree with them now. But at some point, you've got to wonder about where our country is putting all of its energy. Is any single President -- anyone -- worth all of this time and attention? All politicians, whether you agree with them or not come with a shelf life. They are people. They don't last forever, none of us do. In Trump's case, the expiration date arrives in 13 days, and after that, he will not be President. Now we know a lot is going on, but just for a second, let's take the longitudinal view the long view by which we mean, let's think about what life will be like in February, which is next month. Two weeks from tonight, Donald Trump will no longer be in control of our nuclear arsenal. He will not have command of a Federal agency or even most likely his own Twitter account. As much as all of that may upset you, it is nevertheless true, and we cannot change it. The rest of us -- and this is the key, will still be here. We've got nowhere to go. We don't have foreign passports. We're staying until the end. So, what is life going to be like for us on January 21? Not many people seem to be thinking about that up to and including the people we pay to think about it, our political leaders. Donald Trump thinks almost exclusively about Donald Trump, but so does almost every single Democrat in the Congress as well as every single Republican. All of them, every one of them is Trump obsessed. Who is you obsessed? Who has got your concerns top of mind? Who wakes up in the middle of night worried about your family? As far as we can tell, no one, and that's the main thing we need to change. It won't be easy, but the themes are pretty clear. And here are the basics. The point of the Republican Party is not to protect the personal reputations of its leaders. That cannot be the priority. The point of the Republican Party is to protect its voters. In practice, that means protecting the Bill of Rights, our most basic freedoms; those are the bedrock promises of American life, without them you wouldn't want to live here. Those freedoms are incalculably more important than any single politician. Donald Trump could become immortal and win the next 40 presidential elections and his daughter the next 40 after that. But if America becomes a place where you have to violate your own conscience in order to hold a job, where you're not allowed to protect your family from mob violence, where your children can't afford to get married and raise your grandchildren because employers don't like their skin color, then what's the point of all of it? There is no point. No one wants to live in a place like that or should have to no matter who the President is. We should be very concerned about all of this right now. These are the core concerns. Much more concerned than we are about whether Donald Trump can claim that he actually won Pennsylvania or Arizona or whatever. The Trump protest at the Capitol yesterday is already being used as a pretext for an unprecedented crackdown on civil liberties. Just in the last several hours, we have heard people in positions of power and authority demand that those who support Donald Trump should no longer be allowed to publish books or use the internet or fly on airplanes. Driving cars, holding jobs, staying in hotels, those will certainly be next and we're barely exaggerating. In fact, we're predicting it. To justify mind bending terrifyingly un-American demands like these, they are, as usual relying on lies and hysteria. What happened yesterday, they are telling us wasn't simply that a political protest got out of hand after the President recklessly encouraged it. That is, in fact, what happened, but it's not what they're saying. Instead, they're calling it domestic terrorism. CNN describes it as an insurrection. Chuck Schumer likened it to Pearl Harbor. It was really our generation's 9/11. And needless to say, it was white supremacy. Today, to name just one small but revealing example, the Berkshire School in Massachusetts, a boarding school that cost $64,000.00 a year to attend, sent a letter to parents describing what happened yesterday as quote, ""These acts of violence and racism."" Now, if you're a literal person tied to outdated Western notions of linear thought and fact; that might confuse you. Racism? Whatever you thought about what happened yesterday, what was racist about it? Well, nothing, of course. There's nothing racist about it. The Berkshire School is lying. So is everyone else on the left. Why are they doing that? Simple. They know that if they keep saying it, history will record it as true. They understand in other words, the power of language, and that's why they try to control language. They know that words have consequences. This is scary. In the face of it, the party that should be stepping in to stop it, to push back, to tell the truth in the face of lies and to protect its voters from this deception and the destruction that inevitably comes next, that party does nothing. Often, in fact, they join in. This afternoon, a group of Republican staffers on Capitol Hill, lawyers who work for Republican elected officials texted each other and concluded that actually now that we think about it, yesterday's protest rally really was racist. Yes, it was racist. Those are the people protecting you. With bodyguards like this, tens of millions of Americans have no chance. They're about to be crushed by the ascendant left. The people say, oh, I don't think they should be able to fly on airplanes. What country is this? These people need a defender. You need a defender. Why is no one defending them? The main problem - and this really is the main problem -- on the right, anyway, the people who run the Republican Party don't really like their own voters and they especially don't want the voters that Trump brought. Trump brought the party's ranks noticeably downscale from the country club to the trailer park as they often sneer, and this horrifies them. Many Republicans in Washington now despise the people they're supposed to represent and protect. And by the way, it is not just Republican leaders who feel this way, it's our entire leadership class. It is everyone in charge. You rarely hear it spoken out loud, but this is the truth: a very specific form of intra-white loathing at the core of the reaction to Donald Trump. Here is what it is: nothing is more repulsive to socially anxious white professionals than working class people who look like them. Proles are their single greatest fear; they remind them of where they may have come from, or where they could be going if things turn south. So, if you want to understand the hatred, the real hatred, not just disagreement, but gut-level loathing and fear of Trump, in say, New York or Washington or LA, you've got to understand that first. It's not really Trump, it is his voters. The new money class despises them. Trump didn't despise them and that really was his secret in the end. He didn't have much in some ways, but Donald Trump did not judge his own voters. In real life, Trump actually ate McDonald's, that's true, and they knew it was true and they were very grateful for it. And you'd be grateful for it too if everyone else hated you. Pretty soon, like 13 days from now, these voters -- tens of millions of them -- will not have Donald Trump to protect them, they won't have anyone. And unless the Republican Party decides to wake up and push back against the lies in progress and acknowledge the purpose of those lies, which is an unprecedented crackdown on the way you live, you will have no chance either. Miranda Devine is a columnist for ""The New York Post"" and she joins us tonight. Miranda, thanks so much for coming on. We've had you on the show many times to talk about your reporting in ""The New York Post"" reporting into the Bobulinski story, the Hunter Biden's story, many stories that as a political matter helped Donald Trump in this last election in November. Tonight, you have written -- yesterday, you wrote a really interesting piece about Donald Trump's effect on the Republican Party. And so, it occurred to me, you are one of the people we trust to describe what that is. I think you're a fair arbiter on this question. Tell us what you think the effect of the party has been over the last four years. MIRANDA DEVINE, COLUMNIST, ""THE NEW YORK POST"": Well, look, it is tragic what happened yesterday and that is catastrophic I think for the Republican Party, but also for conservatives, for the nationalist populist that Trump represented and for Donald Trump and his legacy. But it's not just about what happened yesterday, it is about the last four years of Trump and his supporters being demeaned and defamed. And, you know, every effort made to destroy his presidency, to discredit the 2016 election, to lie, to use the apparatus of the state, the Intelligence agencies, to impeach him. I mean, there was not a dirty trick that Nancy Pelosi and her Democratic Party did not employ against Donald Trump with the full help of the media. And so that did not go unnoticed by Donald Trump supporters. I traveled around, you know, to various battleground states and talked to them and they hated the media because they felt that they had been traduced. It's not just about Donald Trump. It is about getting at those 75 million people, the deplorables who are so loathed. You just explained so well why they are and they are now disenfranchised once Donald Trump goes. And the idea that these people who are now you know, cutting off Donald Trump from his Twitter account and deciding that they're going to completely discredit his entire reign, to trash his legacy, and to go after everybody who ever supported him, that is not going to help. That is going to just exacerbate and accelerate the forces that already were there before Donald Trump came to power, and are still there, not satiated, not happy and furious, and you saw that breakout yesterday. It was wrong, what happened, but it's a symptom of something going on behind the scenes that's very dangerous. CARLSON: If you hit populism, then try to alleviate the suffering that causes it. I just -- I can't get over the reaction to the woman from San Diego who was shot yesterday by the police within the Capitol. She was going through the window, she was armed. Look, I'm not even taking a position on it, other than to say, how sad. How sad that someone died. I haven't heard anybody say that. It's like, oh, yes, she got whatever -- she deserved it or death is used as a way to attack Trump. I'm not defending Trump. I hated what happened yesterday, and I said it. But we can't have compassion for her because she liked Trump? I'm like, what is this? DEVINE: It's obscene. You know, it's like some humans are worth half humanity and others if they're on the wrong ideological side don't. You had Kirsten Gillibrand this afternoon saying, oh, who cares about that woman effectively. She was a terrorist. She was told not to come in. Well, that wasn't true. I mean, if you've seen that footage of how she died, it's tragic that that happened. And you know, she was unarmed. And we've seen cases, you know, where they've been riots. There are still riots going on about armed men shot by police who didn't die. How come this woman is different? CARLSON: Because she's from the wrong social class, and you know that as well as I do. That's exactly what this is about. They hate the proles: the ones who look like them but are from a different social strata. They hate them. It's amazing. Miranda, it is great to see you tonight. Thank you for that analysis. DEVINE: Thanks a lot, Tucker. CARLSON: So we've watched for six months as our leaders, Big Business in particular has literally bailed violent criminals out of jail to go commit more crimes defended anarchists, but now, those very same people want you to know what we've been saying all along, rioting is bad. Some people are still exempt though. We will tell you who gets a free pass, next. CARLSON: I think it is fair to say there's no show in all American media that's been more consistently and aggressively against political protests that end up breaking things and hurting people. We are against them no matter who conducts them, no matter what the pretext is, no matter what the justification. We said that last night not to score points with anyone because we mean it. What's interesting is how everyone else's standards have changed and very quickly. Our media class wants you to know that what happened yesterday at the Capitol was domestic terror. It was a MAGA terror insurrection. So, we thought we need to replace cops with social workers, but not on Capitol Hill because that's where the politicians live. The interesting point and we can't make this enough, we've going to continue to make it because it tells you everything. The media didn't always think that violent political protests were a big deal. In fact, last year when BLM was destroying our cities, torching places like Kenosha and Minneapolis, riots are positively romantic. They were the language of the unheard. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Civil Rights revolutionary, Martin Luther King, Jr. once said, ""But in the final analysis, a riot is the language of the unheard. And what is it that America has failed to hear?"" Over 50 years later, what is America still not hearing? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Martin Luther King said riots are the language of the unheard. KELLIE CARTER JACKSON, PROFESSOR OF AFRICANA STUDIES, WESLEYAN COLLEGE: Martin Luther King said it best a riot is the language of the unheard. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They are not interested in talking about when Dr. King said that a riot is the language of the unheard, and the implication there is if we listened better to communities and actually treat folks the way that they deserve, that we wouldn't be in these situations in the first place. CARLSON: What's really amazing is that the rest of us sat by and by rest of us, we mean, I don't know, the American business community that now has found its moral voice as of yesterday? Every elected leader in America sat by and let people say crap like that on television, justifying violence, the murder of a lot of people, as if it was totally normal. Yes, it's totally fine. Point made. But the point today is that all of a sudden, this is not the language of the unheard. These are people who are unheard for a good reason, they should just shut up and go to prison or be shot to death. What to make of all of this? Truly? Matt Walsh has thought a lot about this question. He is the host of ""The Matt Walsh Show."" We're always happy to have him on the show. Matt, thanks so much for coming on. MATT WALSH, ""THE DAILY WIRE"": Thanks for having me. Thank you. CARLSON: Sorry, I lost control there for a second. But put a finer point on this that I'm capable of doing. What are we looking at? WALSH: Well, I think this is why I have no patience for the what-about-ism charge because when you when you bring up this point about how the media and the Democrats have been explicitly encouraging, promoting and romanticizing violent protests, political violence riots, it's always what's what-about-ism ? So what they're basically telling us is, we have to take this event that happened yesterday, look at it, pretend that it happened in a void and that it is mysteriously disconnected from everything that happened before it. And that's just, of course, completely ridiculous. It happened in the context, in environments where we're being told that it's okay now to do this, all of those clips you just played. So the people that did this riot, they heard the same thing. They heard this from the media. And so I think a lot of them said, well, okay, this is okay now. This is an effective way to get our point across. And oh, by the way, if it works to do this, if we will get what we want by doing this, then why shouldn't we do it? And all the, you know, the arguments from the left that well, that was totally different because, you know, in this case, they're attacking a government building, whereas before they were just burning down private businesses. First of all, that's not true because they were taking over police stations and burning them to the ground. Second of all, is it really better to burn down, you know, your neighborhood convenience store? Is that really better than swarming Capitol Hill? I think they're equally as barbaric in my mind. CARLSON: It's all awful. But what's so terrifying is they were able to leverage the death, apparently the fentanyl OD of a guy in Minneapolis over Memorial Day into changing America completely. Like your kids' schools are different. Your kid may not get a job because of that, like everything is different because of that. Why will they not leverage what happened yesterday to change American life still more to your disadvantage? And I'm serious. WALSH: Well, and they will. And that's part of the point. I think this is something that people on the right need to understand. First of all, we shouldn't be participating in riots because they are destructive and stupid. CARLSON: Yes, I agree. WALSH: If you want to make all the bad things a lot worse, then a riot is a great way to do it. But only if you're on the right, because the left owns the system. So it just -- it doesn't work -- we don't we don't have the same rules because we don't own the system the way the left does. CARLSON: I don't think we can put up with the elimination of the Bill of Rights. There has got to be the one. Matt Walsh, I hope you will come back on. Thank you. WALSH: Thank you. CARLSON: So right now, serious people are upset about what happened yesterday in Washington, they want to figure out exactly what happened and they want to know why it happened. But none of the people who should be asking are asking; instead, they're taking the opportunity to mock the people who were there because they're from the wrong social class. As events unfolded yesterday, one CNN anchor, who by the way, is the son of a Vanderbilt, which is relevant, he may have blue genes made it explicit: Trump supporters are bad because they eat at lowbrow restaurants. ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: Look at them. They're high-fiving each other for this deplorable display of completely unpatriotic, completely against law and order, completely unconstitutional behavior. It's stunning. And they're going to go back, you know, to the Olive Garden and to the Holiday Inn that they're staying at in the Garden Marriott AND they're going to have some drinks, and they're going to talk about the great day that they had in Washington, and they really did something and stand up for something. And they stood up for nothing other than mayhem. CARLSON: It's just class war by another name, and never has it been more clear than in that clip. By the way, how much do you appreciate the lecture on patriotism and law and order from CNN? Did you appreciate that? I hope so. But the point is, there are two standards; one that applies to you and the other that applies to the pasty pink haired Antifa rioters. They can do whatever they want. They of course will go back to Sag Harbor at the end of the day and stay with their parents, it is totally fine. But Trump supporters, they are insurrectionists. They should be hunted down. Today, CNN unveiled the Soviet-style enemies list to make it a little easier to find all those Trump supporters and then destroy them. BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: And next, we will roll the tape on all of the President's enablers who are all helped to -- who have all helped to fuel the deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. CARLSON: Man, that is a Jeff Zucker order if there ever was one. We don't have the tape of the morning call this morning, unfortunately. We'd bet you money that somewhere along the chain of command at CNN, Jeff Zucker said, oh, it was a deadly insurrection. That's what we're calling it. Again, they understand how to use language and they use language not simply to describe what happened or not even primarily, they use it for political ends. The insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. It wasn't insurrection, it was a political protest that got completely out of control, as we said before, because the president recklessly encouraged it, and that's wrong. But it was not an insurrection. Stop with the lying. In 2018, rioters occupied the Senate Office building during the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation hearings. Was that an insurrection? No, it was wrong. We were against at the time, we were against it yesterday. It wasn't an insurrection. Here's the scene outside the Supreme Court that day. CARLSON: Steve Krakauer is the editor of the ""Fourth Watch"" podcast. We're happy to have him on tonight. Steve, on one level, you know, I welcome -- I want to welcome CNN to the fraternity of people who are against violent political protests, okay, we've been here a long time, they just arrived. But on the other hand, and this is sincere, I feel like they're encouraging an authoritarian crack down on people who disagree with their politics. An enemies list on TV, like, what is this? This is starting to make me really nervous. And I mean it. STEVE KRAKAUER, FOUNDER, ""FOURTH WATCH"": Yes, I think it's -- it is -- it's sort of alarming and that Anderson Cooper clip, I think is just -- it's this great example, a case study of how to see the moral high ground here. Anderson Cooper, you know, before that, he said that these rioters were criminal should be shamed, and I agree with that. And then he continues on and it really is sort of the veil drops, right? It used to be this this thing that we don't really talk about, this disdain, not just for Donald Trump, but for Donald Trump's supporters and for those who voted for him. But, you know, the Olive Garden and the Holiday Inn, I mean, it's just so gross. And honestly, it's so self-defeating. I think you look at Anderson Cooper five years ago, and he was interviewing Donald Trump in a way that if you look at it now, it would be viewed as like normalizing Donald Trump as like, you know, a part of like state TV because he was daring to have a conversation with him. Look how far the pendulum has swung in just a few years. Now, we get this - - Anderson Cooper used to go to, you know, war zones and to natural disasters to report and now he is doing this to mocking the supporters. It is so transparent, and it's really unfortunate and honestly, you know, it opens people's eyes to the media this way. Something really serious and horrible happened in the Capitol yesterday and it's not just enough to cover the minority of people that were at a peaceful protest, hundreds of thousands of people that were peacefully protesting. They were ignored. The couple hundred that were, you know, doing criminal acts, they were covered. Okay, fine. You know, I get it. But to go to this extreme, and as you point out, to not do this, it makes it more glaringly transparent when the same sort of thing, this mostly peaceful protest, well, that's exactly what we had yesterday, but when it was the social justice protests, it was only the mostly peaceful part and not the rioting and looting and arson that happened that was covered. CARLSON: And what's so interesting is, no one ever asked the obvious because you're supposed to be journalists, you just ask the obvious questions like why would people vote for Donald Trump for President? Why are they so emotionally attached to him? Why do they read this Q stuff online? No, a sincere question. Why would they do that? Maybe those are signs that something is not going right in American society, and maybe you're implicated in it. The same people who lecture you about structural racism, never stand back and say maybe there are economic structures here that are hurting people to the extent that they are this frustrated. Does anyone ever ask that question at CNN, do you think? KRAKAUER: I don't think so. I mean, 74 million people in this country voted for Donald Trump. How many people at CNN -- forget voted for Donald Trump - - know someone who voted for Donald Trump, care to find out? Because you don't talk about people the way that Anderson Cooper did in that clip, if you know, people who actually supported Donald Trump and do that because you'd have -- it's a complete lack of nuance. It's a complete lack of interest or curiosity, and it's a total dishonesty there. And I would also just say, the Olive Garden is delicious, and I think that should be also known and there's nothing wrong with people eating at the Olive Garden. CARLSON: My producer just said we got it for the whole staff today. I can't deal with the bread. There is too much bread. I would eat it all. I have been eating too much. But I'm pro Olive Garden. Steve, great to see you. Thank you. KRAKAUER: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: So among the many still outstanding questions from yesterday, why exactly was there so little apparent security at the Capitol building? How do people break the windows facing the street? It's a more interesting story than you may have heard. We'll tell you what we've learned after the break. CARLSON: We're learning tonight that a Capitol Hill police officer is in very tough shape in the hospital following everything that happened yesterday at the Capitol. The Capitol Police just issued a statement clarifying that contrary to many news reports, that officer is not dead. You're seeing news accounts say that four other people died yesterday. Three of those deaths are attributed to something called medical emergencies. We don't know what that means. All deaths seem like medical emergencies. Hopefully, we're going to find out details on that. We do know one we've told you about, an Air Force veteran was shot by the Capitol Police inside the building. So all of this happened yesterday at the nation's Capital, the kind of thing you didn't think could happen there. So how did it happen? The authorities don't have an answer yet. The Police Chief of Washington, D.C., Robert Conti suggested that officers were taken completely by surprise. QUESTION: Was there any Intelligence that suggested that there would be an attempted breach of the U.S. Capitol? ROBERT CONTI, POLICE CHIEF, WASHINGTON, D.C.: There was no Intelligence that suggested that there would be a breach of the U.S. Capitol. CARLSON: Well, there's clearly no Intelligence. I mean, that's pretty obvious. We're not experts. But in contrast to the D.C. Police, we do know how to use search engines, and here's what we found. Thousands of people were openly planning on storming the Capitol building, and they were doing it all week on major internet forums. They could have found it if they tried. In one case, a guy posted a map of the Capitol Complex and its underground tunnels. ""Surround the enemy,"" the post read, ""Storm the Senate,"" wrote someone else. We're also learning tonight that Capitol Hill Police refused help from The Pentagon and the F.B.I. We don't know what this adds up to. We really don't, but we'd certainly like to find out. Danny Coulson is a former Deputy Assistant Director of the F.B.I. and he joins us tonight. Danny Coulson, thanks so much for coming on. DANNY COULSON, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF THE F.B.I.: Thank you. CARLSON: What happened here? What does this mean exactly? It's weird. COULSON: Well, first of all, I didn't have any Intelligence, but I knew it was going to happen. All you have to do is have commonsense and absent that, you have to get ready. When you're a security person or you run a security operation, which this is, you what if yourself to death. You look at your assets, your capabilities, your structure, and you ask yourself, or you have somebody come in and say, look, if this happens, you've got a big problem here. They had clearly no contingency plan. They were understaffed and they ignored all the signs that there is going to be a problem. That's really a shame. CARLSON: But why? I mean, it's the U.S. Capitol. It's the most politically intense time in my lifetime, anyway, certainly in over 50 years. And so why wouldn't you be prepared for this? They knew there was a major rally and they knew that Trump supporters were really mad because they thought the election was stolen from their candidate, so it really is strange. COULSON: I can't give you an answer to that. It makes no sense to me. I'm in the security business. I have secured heads of state in Africa and South America and in the United States and I just don't understand what they were doing. Why weren't they preparing? Did they not have the ability to prepare? Did they not talk about it? Clearly, you could tell from the actions of the officers there from the film we saw, they didn't know what to do. They didn't know what their red lines were. They didn't know what the rules of engagement were. They didn't know at what point that they can allow people in and stop them and move someplace else. They weren't ready. They just didn't prepare. They could have prepared. But let's say this, the officers individually acted heroically, and remember, not one Member of Congress was injured, not because of planning or preparation, because of the courage those people there that were protect them. CARLSON: It's just -- it was grotesque to see Joe Biden today accuse them of racism, which he did. If this had been black protesters, he would have been much different. So he is basically saying, these people protected him his entire adult life and he is accusing him of racism. Really? How do you think they feel about that? COULSON: I think they're devastated. I think they're absolutely devastated. They were in fear for their life. CARLSON: Yes. COULSON: There's no doubt. CARLSON: How many more people did he want them to shoot? I mean, seriously. Danny Coulson, great to see you. Thank you. COULSON: Thank you. CARLSON: So Democrats are hyperventilating about a coup. It's not enough to say this was bad. It has to be Pearl Harbor again. Why are they saying that? Obviously, so they can get more power. When people are terrified, they generally trust their leaders and obey. The Mayor of Washington, D.C., Muriel Bowser has done a really bad job running the city but doesn't understand that principle. That's why she thinks the violence at the Capitol building it means that Washington should become a state immediately. Don't think about it, says Muriel Bowser, just go ahead and give her more power. MAYOR MURIEL BOWSER (D), WASHINGTON, D.C.: First, we must get statehood on the President's desk within the first 100 days of the 117th Congress. Congress must immediately transfer command of the District of Columbia National Guard from the President of the United States and put it squarely under the command and control of the Mayor of the District of Columbia. CARLSON: You never let a crisis go to waste. Wreck the country. Tom Cotton is the Senator from the State of Arkansas. We're happy to have him on tonight. Senator, thank you for coming. Two-part question. I mean, can this really be the pretext for the unconstitutional act of adding the worst run city in America, D.C. to the flag? And second, can you stop it, honestly? SEN. TOM COTTON (R-AR): Yes, Tucker, good to be on with you. Happy New Year. Well, yesterday should not be the pretext for D.C. statehood because D.C. should not be a state. It is a Federal City. It was designed to be a Federal City by our founding fathers. It would be an unconstitutional act, but I wouldn't put it past the Democrats to try to do it. Look, the circumstances are unclear yesterday about when and how the National Guard was mobilized. But it was Muriel Bowser who thought the National Guard should not have weapons. They'd have to go back to their barracks east of the Capitol if they wanted to get weapons to help stop the mob violence we saw yesterday. Second, can they do it? It would require ending the filibuster. They'd have to have brute force, all 50 democratic senators along with Kamala Harris' vote to overturn the filibuster. Joe Manchin has already said he won't do that, not just because of D.C. statehood, because it would then put him on the spot for terrible things like the Green New Deal, which would devastate his state's economy or packing the Supreme Court or anything else that's on the far left of the Democratic agenda, which is just a reminder that they have a radical agenda, but they actually have historically small margins. It's 50/50 in the Senate, and Nancy Pelosi has the smallest margin in the House in decades. CARLSON: Yes, if you're vesting your hopes in Joe Manchin, you know, you've reached a pretty desperate place, I would say. No offense to Joe Manchin, but seriously, you should not be in control of America. Do you think now that maybe some of the strategists over the White House should have been paying a little more attention to those two Senate races in Georgia, rather than, you know, trying to re-litigate, say the results in Pennsylvania because maybe this has real consequences for the rest of us who have to stay here? COTTON: Yes, Tucker. The Georgia races were hugely consequential, that's why I campaigned so much for Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue. It would be much better to have a Republican majority and not have to worry on the fortitude of any Democratic senator to resist the far left of their party. But this is the world we live in. It's going to be a 5050 Senate and Joe Biden will be President in 13 days. Republicans have to get organized. We have to have a plan. We have to show those Democratic senators just how unpopular that agenda is. CARLSON: You know, I spent 35 years in D.C., so if you need someone to testify on how the city is run, just call me. You've got my cell. I appreciate it. Senator Cotton, great to see you. COTTON: Thank you. CARLSON: So 75-year-olds you think would be at the front of the line for the coronavirus vaccine. Imagine a state in which you could be fined a million dollars for giving a 75-year-old the coronavirus vaccine. That's real. And we'll tell you where it is happening. We'll talk to someone who is fighting back against it. That's next. CARLSON: The New York State since the first day has been really the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak. If any state needs the vaccine, it would be New York, obviously. But here's the amazing thing, right now, New York currently ranks 28th in the United States in vaccine distribution. There's a reason for that. Phil Boyle is a New York State Senator. He joins us tonight to assess what's going on in New York. Phil Boyle, thanks so much for joining us. Why is New York -- which you think would be number one, twenty eighth? PHIL BOYLE (R-NY), STATE SENATOR: Well, I think, Tucker, because Governor Cuomo was thinking about other things. If you think about the chronology last March in April, we had a huge first surge of COVID here in New York State and then the numbers went far down in July and August. But we all knew the vaccines were coming, and that's when the Governor should have focused on finding distribution sites, creating a real plan for getting vaccine these vaccines out. If you think about it, what was he doing? He was creating a poster. He was writing a book. He was arguing on another network with his brother about who their mother liked more. He was not focused on the distribution centers. CARLSON: So you'd think and I think to be fair, this would be true in every state that people over 70 would be first in line, the older people are, the more priority they would be given. That is not the case in New York, why? BOYLE: Correct. The Governor is focusing on healthcare workers, so just fine, frontline healthcare workers. However, they should be focusing on the most senior among us. I have constituents of mine on Long Island, over 75, over 70, over 65 and they're watching on TV seeing people in Florida driving up, getting the vaccination in their arm and driving away and they're asking me: how can I go down to Florida to get the vaccine? These lifesaving vaccines? That's scary and sad. CARLSON: Well, some people have driven to Florida like I know some, driven from New York or New Jersey to the State of Florida. They'll probably just stay like so many thousands of others. Phil Boyle, I appreciate you coming on tonight. Thank you. BOYLE: Thank you, Tucker. CARLSON: Well, so much is happened in the past 24 hours, so you're probably asking pretty basic, but important questions and the first one is this: where do we go from here? Where does the country go from here? The smartest person we know, Victor Davis Hanson joins us after the break. CARLSON: So the first casualty of a moment like this is clarity. So many things happen at once bad people take advantage of that. But it's hard to know exactly what is going on. And so as we have so many times in the past, we're joined tonight by a man who explains the big picture better than any other: Victor Davis Hanson, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution. Happy to have him on tonight. Professor, thanks for coming on. What do you make of this? VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION: Well, while this is all going on, this melodrama is tragedy. Joe Biden is going to be President in two weeks and we don't know what he's going to do because we're locked in an existential struggle with China and from what we hear, he disapproves of the Trump policy toward China. What does that mean? Does that mean we're going to go back to managing decline again and overlook Chinese egregious behavior? We had a breakthrough in the Middle East, Tucker. Are the Palestinians going to go back to the central discussion of the entire disagreement? Are we going to go back to the Iran deal? Are we going to tell the moderate Arab countries, you know what, please don't recognize Israel? That only emboldens the Netanyahu government. Is that what we're going to do? We don't know. Are we going to tell our European allies, we're going to go back and sort of ankle bite you and say, please, please pay your two percent of your required contributions to the Alliance? Is that what we're going to -- I don't know what we're going to do. But it seems that Trump, for all of the demonization of him today and yesterday, he gave a blueprint for a better world abroad, and Biden would be wise to follow it. I don't know if he can, given the left-wing of his party or his own inclinations. Here at home, are we going to go back to the Republican Party sort of a -- I don't want to be caustic, but a silk stocking party that says we really have got to cut more capital gains and privatize Social Security. Is that an open the border? Is that going to really win a post Trump Republican Party? I don't think so. And are we going to say, we need more regulation. Again, we've got to get back to regulating the economy. We've got to stop fracking on Federal lands. We've got to have this New Green Deal. We've got more Solyndra, because that worked last time, is that what we're going to do? So we're all angry right now. But there's a lot of existential questions that haven't been answered and that was an artifact of the election where Joe Biden really did not campaign and he didn't articulate a vision. And there was a cynicism that he was compromised by the left-wing of his party in a Faustian bargain. And all of that is going to be unveiled, Tucker, but it's going to be unveiled in a canvas where we haven't seen something since 1932. He is going to have the Senate. He is going to have the House. He is going to have the presidency. And as you pointed out, he's one vote away from ending the Senate filibuster and that's going to unleash an entire thing that we can't even imagine if that should happen from court packing to new states. So it's going to be a wild ride, and I think people had better tighten up because we're going to see things we haven't seen a long time. CARLSON: However you feel about the last election and the allegations of fraud, some of which are clearly real, I mean, shouldn't the rest of us kind of resent to some extent, the fact that no one is talking about this stuff? I mean, if you have to live in this country, shouldn't you be fully aware of what's about to happen and your stake in that. I think the people who should be directing the conversation are just ignoring it like they don't care? But I care. HANSON: Yes, I don't I don't really care whether some ambassador to Northern Ireland or the envoy wants to resign the last 12 days, to virtue signal his displeasure of the person he used to work for. Not one we owe $28 trillion in debt right now and we've exhausted all of this stimuli. If we get into a big, big depression, I mean, we don't -- we're already at zero interest. We already have a $4 trillion deficit. We already have a massive debt. What do you do next to stimulate the economy? And so yes, here in California, we're facing an existential drought. If it continues, like it is, we can't get anybody vaccinated. The Los Angeles and San Francisco under the control of two County Sheriffs are in complete disarray. It's lawlessness under Mr. Boudin and Gascon. So this state is in crisis. And we have a governor who is facing recall. No one is talking about this. This is the fifth largest economy in the world. So yes, there are issues besides which particular Cabinet officer decides in the last 13 days of his tenure that he is morally superior enough so that he has to depart and virtue signal that reality. CARLSON: Yes, that whole -- people who mistake sanctimony for wisdom, I'm a little tired of those -- people are very tired. Victor Davis Hanson, great to see you. HANSON: Thank you. CARLSON: A lot going on. We will be back tomorrow night, you can count on it, 8:00 p.m. The show that is the sworn and totally sincere enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. Sean Hannity right now. Classification"
2021-01-14,"TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. What happened at the Capitol last Wednesday was wrong. We've said that very clearly at the time. We've said it very clearly everyday sense since and we will continue to say it. We are opposed to political violence. We hate mobs. No matter who they claim to represent. Period. But that's not all we're against. We're also against lying. Political propaganda is its own form of violence it. Destroys people's minds. In the end, it enslaves them. You can judge for yourself what happened last Wednesday in Washington. Rarely has an event been filmed from more angles than that was. You know what that was, and you also know what it wasn't. It was not an act of racism. It was not an insurrection. It wasn't an armed invasion by a brigade of dangerous white supremacists. It wasn't. Those are lies. Why are they demanding that you believe those lies? You should wonder about that. When your doctor claims that your broken arm is stage four pancreatic cancer, you need a second opinion. When he demands that you get chemotherapy, you need to run away because something very dark is going on. And indeed, something dark is going on right now. What happened last week in Washington was not new or unusual. In fact, it was sadly familiar. The riot you saw was the perfect illustration of why we should oppose all mob action always. Left uncontrolled, mobs boil over. Violence erupts. People get killed. That is inevitable. That's what always happens. It has happened many times before. Not just over the past year, but over the previous years and previous centuries. In fact, all through human history. That's the way mobs are. Wise leaders know that, that's why they don't encourage mobs. Let's hope that everyone in Washington has learned that lesson. But, of course, they haven't learned it. Instead, they are trying to use this moment to increase their own power, so they are lying about what you saw. They are calling it a precisely orchestrated coup attempt. They are telling you that the Chewbacca guy you saw on video, the guy with a painted face and the Viking hat was actually the leader of some super-secret Spetsnaz Commando unit over to overthrow our government. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, the man in the coon skin cap may have looked like he took a wrong turn at a Packers game and wound up on the floor of the House of Representatives, but don't be deceived. This man is a mastermind in the ways of the espionage. The Chewbacca guy was the fact the tip of the insurrection spear. Hide the children. Marshal the Federal troops. How absurd and insulting all of this is. First of all, it's untrue. It's a lie. And yet, it's working and that's why they are saying it. They are using what happened last week to justify the most sweeping crackdown on civil liberties and free speech in the history of this country. Are you surprised they are doing that? You shouldn't be surprised. We lived through something similar this summer. We have seen the template for what they will do and what they plan to do. Over Memorial Day, a man died in police custody in Minneapolis. There was dramatic video of that happening. People who saw it were upset. In the end, we learned that what we thought happened was not even close to what actually happened, but by then it was too late. The usual frauds and demagogues have leveraged that moment to change this country forever. They used hysteria to subdue the population and to crush anyone who dared to ask questions about what they were doing. They tried hard to pull this show off the air for example. To this day, the same group maintains strict ideological orthodoxy through threats and fear. Not through argument or reason, but through coercion. Here's an actual headline from the other day from the sports blog ""Deadspin,"" quote, ""Fans rip Phillies other trade for Black Lives Matter hater/batting practice pitcher Sam Coonrod."" The article describes that Sam Coonrod is a MAGA guy and suggests that he is a racist. That sounds scary. Here's what Sam Coonrod actually said. This was his crime, quote: ""I just can't get on board with a couple of things I have read about Black Lives Matter, how they lean toward Marxism and they said some negative things about the nuclear family,"" end quote. So Sam Coonrod isn't for Marxism. Sam Coonrod likes the nuclear family -- so we better crush him. Meanwhile, and this was the point all along, a small number of genuinely radical haters and nihilists have stepped into the void where our national conversation used to be and taken total control of the floor. They say things that virtually no one in this country actually agrees with, but since no one else is allowed to talk, they have a mop be monopoly on what we do next. Here's the dumbest and most narcissist of all of them, the Kim Kardashian of the Congress. Yammering on about how actually because of the death in Minneapolis, we need to get rid of the police. REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): So if you are an elected official that for any reason is on this call, I'm asking you to ask yourself: what are you willing to sacrifice to make sure that over funded police departments are defunded? CARLSON: So, suddenly -- and let us know if this sounds familiar -- a convicted felon dying of a drug overdose was a national crisis? As in any national crisis, you have got to make some sacrifices. And guess what? Every one of your sacrifices is going to make vacuous little totalitarians morons like Sandy Cortez more powerful. That's how national crises work. Something bad has happened therefore you have to hand the worst people in the world the keys to your life. See how that works? As if you needed more evidence that it's all about what's good for Sandy Cortez and her friends and not about what's good for you because nobody cares about that. Watch her new position, her revised position on defunding the police. This is from the other day. CORTEZ: Many of us nearly narrowly escaped death. There were members of Capitol Police who were quite heroic. You know, we have many officers and, you know, there was -- there were also black and brown officers that were confronting white supremacists and putting themselves not just to protect Members, but they put themselves in harm's way. CARLSON: ""Narrowly escape death."" One of the most harrowing things in life is pass Freshman Sociology at Boston University, every day is a brand new drama. Sandy's heart is still beating fast. But she likes the cops now despite the fact that they are white supremacists. What a difference a day makes. And Sandy Cortez is not alone. Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts has also, for the moment, changed her view of violent civil unrest. Here she was just a few months ago. REP. AYANNA PRESSLEY (D-MA): Hold them accountable. Make the phone call, send the e-mail. Show up. You know, there needs to be unrest in the streets for as long as there is unrest in our lives, and unfortunately, there is plenty to go around. CARLSON: ""So there needs to be unrest in the streets,"" quote. Actually, we don't need unrest, Ayanna Pressley has concluded. Unrest in the streets is now racist. Watch. PRESSLEY: It was a harrowing experience. They were terrorizing Members of Congress and all who work in the Capitol, our staff. Feeling unsafe is not new and certainly being a black woman and feeling unsafe is not new. CARLSON: No, feeling unsafe is not new for Ayanna Pressley. She felt particularly unsafe, particularly in peril as she attended the single most private school in Chicago growing up and it was even scarier when she arrived like her friend, Sandy Cortez on the mean streets of Boston University. So Ayanna Pressley knows well what it's like to be persecuted and oppressed and that friends, is why you should no longer be allowed to speak in public or read the websites you like or watch this show. Just today ""The New York Times"" published a column by Nic Kristof that made that entirely sensible point, quote, ""I'd like to see pressure on advertisers to withdraw from FOX News so long as it functions as extremist madrassa, and cable providers should be asked why they distributes that peddle lies."" You won't be surprised to learn that the rest of the media, our competitors strongly agree with that sentiment. The government needs to shut down FOX News. People who watch FOX News, meanwhile, that would be you, need to be, quote, ""deprogrammed."" Presumably in some kind of residential facility. Reeducation camps, if you will. Now we can't say specifically what the plan is. Honestly, we haven't thought a lot about it. MSNBC though has thought a lot about it. EUGENE ROBINSON, ""WASHINGTON POST"" COLUMNIST AND MSNBC REGULAR: There are millions of Americans, almost all white, almost all Republicans, who somehow need to be deprogrammed. It's as if they are members of a cult, the Trumpist cult and have to be deprogrammed. Do you have any idea how we start that process? CARLSON: Did you hear that? ""They are almost all white."" ""Do you have any idea how we start that process?"" Ask someone else on the set, like it's a perfectly reasonable suggestion and not at all dangerously insane. It turns out that many Democrats do in fact have some ideas on how to start the process. Sandy Cortez by the way has been thinking about this since Sociology class at B.U. and she has concluded we need a government commission to shut down media outlets that might criticize her. CORTEZ: There is absolutely is a commission that's being discussed. Several Members of Congress in some of my discussions have brought up media literacy because that is a part of what happened here. We're going to have to figure out how we rein in our media environment so you can't just spew disinformation and misinformation. CARLSON: You can't just spew disinformation like criticizing Sandy Cortez, you can't do that in this country. It is not like it is a free country with a First Amendment. No, not anymore. This is all moving pretty fast. It always does move pretty fast. But don't you worry, it's for your safety. Up in Canada, the Heritage Minister just announced this week that that country will introduce new regulations to ban social media posts that are deemed hurtful or offensive. ""We want to protect Canadians online,"" the Minister explained. Of course, they want to protect themselves -- sorry, protect you by protecting themselves from criticism from you. See how that works? Right. You're protected when you can't speak. I bet you didn't know that. Jack Dorsey knows that. Jack Dorsey is the CEO of Twitter. He only looks like a pothead, actually he is pretty clever. He takes the long view on these things. Thanks to James O'Keefe at Project Veritas, we know that Jack Dorsey has plans for the rest of us that will extend far beyond the Trump era. Silencing Donald Trump was just the beginning. Guess who is next? You are. Watch. JACK DORSEY, CEO, TWITTER: We are focused on one account right now, but this is going to be much bigger than just one account and it's going to go on for much longer than just this day, this week. I don't believe this is going away any time soon and the moves we are making today around QAnon for instance, one such example of a much broader approach that we should be looking at and going deeper on. CARLSON: So, this is quote ""much bigger"" than silencing just one man and it's going to go on much longer than just this week. So maybe Jack Dorsey isn't so bright. He just admitted out loud what the rest of them are still denying. This isn't really about Donald Trump. It never was. It's definitely not about what happened last week at the Capitol. It is about controlling you and the country you thought was yours forever. Sorry, there is a national crisis going on and we have no choice. Miranda Devine is a columnist for the ""New York Post"" which itself was erased by Silicon Valley before last year's election. She has a piece out today about what we are seeing and we are happy to have her on tonight. Miranda, thanks so much for coming on. Even if you approach this from the perspective we do, and I'm sure you do as well, it's awful. Mob violence of any kind particularly against our Capitol. I don't think I have ever seen a more cynical and sinister response to anything than what we are seeing right now. MIRANDA DEVINE, COLUMNIST, ""THE NEW YORK POST"": It really is incredible. And, you know, there is obviously method in the madness to try and exaggerate the threat to describe Donald Trump, you know, instead of just saying that what he did was wrong, you have to turn him into a complete monster, demonize him. He a white supremacist. And from there it's just a short step to call all his -- the people who voted for him, the 75 million Americans and all their families -- they are white supremacist as well, and the reason for that is because once you've called them the worst thing that you could, you then are able to dehumanize them and you can inflict any cruelty you like on them within impunity because they are now nonpersons. They don't deserve to exist. You can destroy their livelihood, destroy their reputations, alienate them from society, and it doesn't matter because they are evil, white supremacists. CARLSON: You have got to wonder, as I say, where are our defenders? Where are the people we have sent money too over the last 40 years? Voted for? Why aren't they standing up to protect the rest of us? You really do -- at some point, we need to hold them accountable. The people saying that mob violence is wrong, anyone who is saying that is correct, in my view. But a lot of the people currently saying that we are for mob violence like about 20 minutes ago or am I imagining that? DEVINE: It's such an incredible backflip. You saw House Democrats on Wednesday when they were voting to impeach Donald Trump again pointlessly and they are one after the other talking about how great the police are. You know, suddenly they are for police. Suddenly they are for law and order. They are for civility. They are for American history. They revere the founding fathers. They are -- they now like borders. They like walls when it actually they protect their place of work. They now think that it's great. You need to bring the National Guard in to quell civil unrest when it is their peace that is being kept. They like guns when it's their safety that's at stake. They have done an enormous backflip, and they seem to have zero self-awareness. They don't seem to realize that just not very long ago, they were demonizing police as white supremacists and racist. Now police are wonderful, and now mob violence, which they condoned and welcomed and spoke about as if it were some sacred duty, now mob violence is evil and vile and it's a symbol of white supremacy and they get away with it. That's what is so incredible. The double standards, the hypocrisy, they just glide past it and the media allows them to because it's amplifying the double standards. CARLSON: Sure, anyone who disagrees or calls them to account is silenced. That's why every day I wake up grateful that we work for a company that's not dependent on Silicon Valley to get its message to it viewers. I really mean that. Miranda Devine, it is great to see you tonight. Thank you. DEVINE: Me too. Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: This is an amazing story. One of the people who went to Washington last week to watch the President's speech, not to break into the Capitol -- he didn't -- was a musician called Ariel Pink. Because Pink attended that speech, he can no longer make a living in this country. We're not overstating that at all. We spoke to him at some length just a minute ago. We have an interview for you after the break. It's pretty moving and pretty revealing. We'll be right back. [VIDEO CLIP OF ARIEL PINK'S ""ONLY IN MY DREAMS"" PLAYS] CARLSON: Ariel Pink is a musician from Los Angeles and a Trump voter. On January 6, he attended the President's speech in Washington and then he went back to his hotel room and took a nap. He did not go to the Capitol. He participated in no violence whatsoever. He is opposed to violence. But what he did was a crime. He attended a political rally, and now, he has been stripped of his livelihood. Pink's music label Mexican Summer dropped him completely. They wrote this on Twitter, quote: ""Due to recent events, Mexican Summer and it staff has decided to end our working relationship with Ariel Rosenberg aka Ariel Pink moving forward."" It's a moment that tells you a lot about where we are and where we are going. We sat down with Ariel Pink a moment ago and had this conversation. ( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CARLSON: So you are an artist. Artists do transgressive things. You did the most transgressive thing. You came out a public Trump supporter and then you went to a Trump rally. What happened next? ARIEL PINK, MUSICIAN: I went to the White House to see our President, and went to the hotel, took a nap. End of story. CARLSON: When did you find out that your career had been destroyed? PINK: Well, about two days later. By that point -- and my label had written me already sort of to inform me that they were getting a lot of heat and a lot of backlash for supporting me and they reassured me that they were not going to drop me. CARLSON: They always reassure you first, don't they? PINK: And you know, and I was just like, you know, I didn't make any apologies. I was just -- I was -- I felt like I hadn't done anything, so -- but these articles obviously placed me at the siege. CARLSON: Yes. PINK: Which I was not at. And of course, I don't advocate for violence. CARLSON: Of course not. PINK: At all, in any walk of life. CARLSON: And just to be clear, you committed no violence while in Washington. PINK: Of course not. I mean, I was there for a peaceful rally. That's all it was to me. CARLSON: Yes. PINK: And -- but there was no fact-checking or anything like that. These 130 articles went out in the course of 24 hours and just the backlash was just -- they succumbed to cancel culture, so basically that's -- CARLSON: So what did your label say after reassuring you they weren't going to drop you, what happened then? PINK: Well, then they -- then 24 hours later, they wrote back saying that - - they texted me telling me that they were going to go public and drop me at that point. CARLSON: So if you are a recording artist, which you are, and you can't record, what does that mean? PINK; Well, and I can't tour either at this point. So, it pretty much leaves me destitute and on the street. So, yes, I don't know. I'm sort of overwhelmed right now and I don't know be exactly what to do, but ... CARLSON: So for going to a political rally, not participating in violence, not seeing any violence. Not being aware there was violence when you went to bed in your hotel, for that, your career disappeared in one day? PINK: Yes. That's it. CARLSON: Your livelihood gone? PINK: Yes. That's -- no apologies, no support. I have had -- my family has been getting death threats. They don't even know that I'm here. I had to sneak away because they were so terrified of me coming on TV. They have been getting it all week. Me too, the hate is just overwhelming. And just new articles being written just -- just people are so mean. CARLSON: You have lived in this country all your life. Do you recognize it? PINK: Not at all. Not at all. I mean, I'm terrified. I mean, this is what I voted against. CARLSON: Right. PINK: I mean, I didn't vote so much for Trump as against cancel culture and this environment that's been blazing for about four years but that is about to ramp up and get even worse. CARLSON: So I'm just so struck by the fact that you are not a political person. You did not sign up for this. Are you worried that it will destroy you as a person? PINK: No, I'm not so worried about that. I mean, I have been canceled before. I have been canceled many times. I know how the whole thing works. It doesn't really affect my ego. CARLSON: Yes. PINK: Which isn't to say it doesn't hurt my feelings, it does. CARLSON: Yes. PINK: But I know that it's not real. So I just -- you know, I have got family. I have got a small group around me that sort of keeps me centered and I also believe in myself. I know I didn't do anything wrong. So there is no reason why I should feel remorseful about this. CARLSON: Amen. So you know how unreasonable and scary and punitive a moment this is. You are taking a huge risk coming on this show. Why are you doing it? PINK: I don't have any other recourse. Like what am I going to do? Am I going to be able to get my statement out in magazines? I mean, who is -- right now, the narrative is being pushed and there are not very many people that are going to let a counter narrative enter into the fold. I mean, there is just no nuance. There is no kind of -- I don't know what -- I don't know, man. I don't know what I'm going to do. CARLSON: You had no choice, basically, if you want to tell your story. PINK: I had no choice. I had no choice. There is nothing else for me to do. I can't even afford my lawyer right now. CARLSON: Last question. What do you think the purpose of all of this is? PINK: Well, I think it's desperation and fear that is driving this whole thing. I think -- I think there has been a very big effort to unseat the President or at least not let him have four more years which I think is fair and he lost, and I think he lost fairly. I'm not disputing anything. Biden is perfectly fine with me as President, but I think that there was just no -- I think that they are still scared or something like that. It seems like they are sore winners at this point, and people seem to want to kick me down as well much like they have Trump. Kick us down when we are down. You know, I believe are -- I don't even know what -- I don't know what the future is with regards to Trump, but I think, you know -- I don't know. I don't want to comment on that. CARLSON: They are sore winners? PINK: They are sore winners, yes. CARLSON: Good luck. When reasonable people like you are destroyed, all of us should take notice, so I appreciate your telling your story. Thank you. PINK: Thanks, Tucker. ( END VIDEOTAPE) CARLSON: So the life of a guy who did nothing wrong is just crushed. Let's crush this guy because he said something we don't like. We have no connection Ariel Pink. That's not the point. The point is you can't have a country this kind of thing happens. It's awful, and decent people should stand up and say so, and they should fix it. But no one is, because they are cowards. It is happening everywhere. It happened to social media company, Parler. That has now been banned from the internet. That wasn't an accident. It was a result of a massive effort, bigger than just Amazon and Apple and Google. We will tell you who is involved because you should know their names. When this is all over, they should be held to account for what they have done not just to Parler, but to our national life, our intellectual life, our country. Plus, there has been a major escalation in the government's war on the Atilis Gym in New Jersey, speaking of the strong hurting the weak. The gym owner will tell us what is happening to him straight ahead. CARLSON: Destroying the social media app, Parler and ripping it off the Internet was a team effort. It took more than simply Amazon, and Apple and Google. Amy Peikoff is the Chief Policy Officer there at Parler. She joins us to tell which other companies were involved in this historic attack on free speech and our civil liberties because you should know their names. Amy, it's great to see you tonight. Thank you for coming on. I'm sorry, Parler is still not up, as I'm sure our viewers know. Tell us if you would -- because we want to know who they are -- who participated in this attack on the First Amendment and on your company? AMY PEIKOFF, CHIEF POLICY OFFICER, PARLER: Hi, tucker, thanks. So other companies that were involved were Trello who dropped us. We are also having issues with Captcha using any sort of Captcha in our program. Flurry dropped us. There is also people that you weren't really aware of unless you were into the tech, the people who actually connect you to the Internet and provide nodes and the hosts -- domain hosts, et cetera. Those are the people on the tech side that I'm not as aware of, but there are a number of people involved. And whether they are all working together or whether they are all just caving in to the same cancel culture pressure, obviously, at Parler, we do think that we were singled out unfairly because this content that nobody wants on anywhere on their platforms, this inciting content that is wrong, was unfortunately everywhere as you have read in stories this week from ""The Washington Post"" and elsewhere. CARLSON: I assume most of them are just greedy soulless little robots who will do whatever it takes to continue to loot the country. It's not like they have an ideological agenda. PEIKOFF: Whether they have an agenda or not, here is one of the things that I think is going on, at least with the bigger tech companies. You know, people have been talking about collusion. Is there collusion involved? But what if the truth is actually a lot worse and that Parler is just the latest casualty in a sort of it Faustian bargain that Big Tech has made with status government. And by this, I mean that Big Tech has made itself dependent on immunity with respect to its two major prongs for monetization that it depends on. So one of them is this content moderation, removing pieces of content. They have immunity for that under Section 230, and that also includes the curation of feeds and algorithms that they use to that that increase engagement. Those are all just immune from scrutiny and liability. And then the second, of course, is the data pillaging as we like to call it. At Parler, we don't believe that you should be making money by monetizing personal data of people and both of those things have become part of this bargain. I don't know if you saw the ""Wall Street Journal"" piece. It was Big Tech vs. The Constitution. Save the Constitution from Big Tech and they talked about the fact that immunity of 230 when combined with the pressure from people in Congress telling Facebook and telling Twitter that they need to remove more hate speech and do more about misinformation, this is in effect censorship by proxy. And then with respect to data, if you look at the Consent Decree between the United States and Facebook, the F.T.C. and Facebook from last year, you could see in that that Facebook was allowed to continue its data mining practices that help monetize it and then at the same time maybe the F.T.C. and D.O.J. can get backdoors into data under the terms of that Consent Decree. This is a very cozy relationship that I think is very disturbing, and Parler's model doesn't depend on either of those things. CARLSON: Cozy doesn't even describe it. I mean -- PEIKOFF: it's scary. It's really scary. CARLSON: Apple helped write our current immigration law. Some of the liberal children in the current White House considered giving the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Tim Cook f Apple who hates the White House and the country. PEIKOFF: I was going to tell you that with respect to this particular fight, I see Apple as an ally. I don't know be if you saw that Tim Cook has said that Parler could come back on to the App Store after we improve our content moderation. So -- CARLSON: Oh, thank you, Tim Cook. I am really -- I'm glad. Well hopefully, he will wake up in a good mood tomorrow and grant us that favor. Who made these people God anyway? I mean, what world is this where Tim Cook gets to decide? PEIKOFF: At least they stand for privacy, Tucker. At least they stand for privacy. CARLSON: Yes, well -- Amy, I appreciate you coming on tonight. Thank you. PEIKOFF: Thank you. CARLSON: Well, the Governor of New Jersey is very determined to crackdown on crime. Not murders and rapes, but anyone who criticizes the Governor of New Jersey on FOX News and that would include the people who run the Atilis Gym. The owners of that gym have refused to stay closed this year. In November, we spoke to the owner Ian Smith. IAN SMITH, OWNER, ATILIS GYM: So Frank and I are currently being fined personally. Governor Murphy has attempted to pierce the LLC. He has fined us $15,497.76 per day. That fine started as -- CARLSON: Per day? SMITH: Per day, yes. CARLSON: Well the Atilis Gym has not paid those fines, but the state didn't wait around to litigate or adjudicate. They just took $170,000.00 from the gym's bank account because they can do that because they're the state. They don't have to ask permission. So we asked the State of New Jersey about this. They gave us this statement, quote, ""The state previously obtained a judgment from the court in the amount of $134,463.08 which the state intends to collect. Apparently the funds you reference were frozen as a result of a bank levy having been issued due to the state's collection efforts, which is part of the enforcement of the judicial order."" Keep in mind, that all sounds very legal. If you stop paying your rent, how long does it take you to get evicted from your apartment? Probably in New Jersey, a year or two? This happened like that. They targeted these people. Ian Smith is one of them. He is the owner of the gym. He joins us tonight. Ian, thank you for coming on. I'm sorry about this. SMITH: Thank you for having me, Tucker. CARLSON: Has the murder rate dramatically declined in say, Camden? I mean, it seems like the state is focusing an awful lot of resource on crushing you for actually criticizing them. SMITH: No, I think it's higher actually. CARLSON: Yes, right. I'm sorry. I will stop ranting. Tell us what the state of affairs is tonight. SMITH: So, as of yesterday morning, my partner and I checked the bank statement in the morning and we had no money in our bank account. The state emptied out every single dollar that we have. This is in the middle of an appeals process and ongoing litigation in the matter of the fines and several other matters regarding the state including a lawsuit against Governor Murphy and Judith Persichilli herself. This is, as simple as I can put it, this is an interference to our right to counsel. This money in our bank account does not come from memberships. We have not charged our members since April 1st since we originally shut down. This is donations and t-shirt sales that we have used to pay our bills and to fights our legal battles -- and it is a clear and it is a blatant violation of our constitutional rights and our ability to defend ourselves in the court of law. CARLSON: How long do you think they will allow cryptocurrency to exist? I'm sorry, just a thought. Probably not too long. They can't seize it from you. SMITH: No. They can't. And that's actually one of the most frequent recommendations for people who want to continue to donate is set up a crypto account. CARLSON: Yes, while you still can. So, now that they have taken all your money and you can't afford legal defense, what's your path forward? SMITH: We will be fundraising. We put out a video last night explaining the problems that we are facing and we put out a call to help to the many people who have supported us from the beginning and the many people who have learned about our story along the way, and we have got 450 t-shirt orders to fill and a lot of donations coming in. So, from now on, we are going to pull all of our money out and just go at it in cash and write checks as we go. There will be no money in our bank accounts. We will continue to fight this no matter what. CARLSON: I just want to very quickly remind our viewers of two things. You haven't spread COVID to anybody, and I am reminding the Goldman Sachs guy who runs your state, you are being punished for trying to keep people healthy and trim in the middle of a pandemic that kills people who are overweight and out of shape. Doing more than he has to save people's lives and of course, you are being destroyed for it. Ian Smith, I appreciate it. SMITH: I would just -- thank you very much, Tucker. CARLSON: Thank you. Well, you heard many times that every single person at the riot last week was a Trump supporter. Most were, obviously. But not all. The results of our investigation straight ahead. And then this political moment is having a serious effect on our children. One high school student's e-mail puts it better than we can. We are going to bring it to you after the break. CARLSON: The Justice Department said almost immediately that there was quote, ""No evidence of Antifa involvement"" in the riot last week on Capitol Hill, and of course virtually everyone in the media and Washington has backed that up. This was a right-wing attack. Now, because we are not liars, we are going to tell you what you already know which is most of these people seem like Trump supporters, but not everyone was. Today, a self-described BLM and Antifa supporter called John Sullivan was arrested in the State of Utah for his role in the riot and it was a role. He wasn't just there. He posted videos showing himself inside the Capitol Building. He said he was just there to record it while those dangerous right-wingers were doing it. He sat for interviews at MSNBC to tell that story. Watch. ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: Two people who were there join us now, documentary filmmaker, Jade Sacker and left-wing activist, John Sullivan. John, you filmed this moment on your phone just -- can you describe what happened? JOHN SULLIVAN, LEFT-WING ACTIVIST: Yes. So, basically all the protesters kind of stormed to get into the chamber. We tried to get into like the main entrance, right, when you walk down the hallway. CARLSON: Oh, but none of had that was real we now know. It turns out CNN was in fact interviewing an insurrectionist and spreading insurrectionist propaganda. Why do we say that? Because according to charging documents filed today, John Sullivan, the guy you saw on CNN getting sucked up to was actually participating in the riots. While in the Capitol Building, Sullivan said this according to the charging documents, quote: ""It's our house and we are getting this [expletive]."" So who is this John Sullivan, exactly? Well, authorities quote, ""Sullivan encouraging violence at a previous rally in Washington,"" quote, ""We are about to burn this [bleep] down. We've got to rip Trump out of office. We ain't waiting until the next election. We about to get that [bleep]."" Talks like a moron, not surprisingly. Sullivan has been a professional agitator for a while now. Last year he founded a group called Insurgence U.S.A. following the death of George Floyd, the death that led to the whole country being rearranged on false pretext. He led several anti-police and anti-Trump demonstrations and last year was arrested for rioting. His most commonly used something hashtags on Twitter are #BLM. #Antifa. #AbolishThePolice and #FTrump. We want to be absolutely clear about this because, again, we are not liars and we are not going to insult you something that is clearly not true. A lot of people there were clearly Trump supporters. They came from a Trump rally. But facts matter, all the facts matter. And we know now that contrary to what we were told and what CNN told us, this guy was not. We were lied to, not just by the media, but by the government and we should figure out why we were lied to and if there were more people like John Sullivan in the Capitol. We don't know if there were. Let's find out. Why not? We've got it a pretty revealing e-mail recently from a kid called Elliott Morse. It was a copy of something he sent to his teachers the day of a last week's riot at the Capitol. Elliott Morse is 16 years old, he is a sophomore at Duxbury High School in Massachusetts. We want to read to you some of what he wrote. ""Dear Mr. Donovan and Mr. Cucinatto, as the world was shocked by the violence and unprecedented events that occurred on January 6, 2021, these events should be condemned and it should be a wake-up call as to our country to unify and bind together. As I sit on Zoom listening to each teacher speak about these issues, I feel more and more isolated from our community at Duxbury High School."" ""As someone with a view that may not be popular in today's day and age, I feel as though there could be a more effective and better way to talk of going about talking about what happened yesterday in a way that makes people like me feel more welcome."" ""The First Amendment gives me as well as every American the right to freedom of speech. Everyone is entitled to say what they believe. It is inappropriate for teachers to impose their views on their students."" ""I have now sat through four different classes and in three out of four, have spoken about the issue of what happened yesterday. The negativity toward our 45th President and the events, even those people that are Americans like you and me made me realize just how divided our country is."" ""Being on opposite sides of the spectrum, it never crossed my mind until I went into A.P. Government to speak about the election and the protest. This topic is very tough to speak about and has many different sides. That being said, neither side is right, and neither side should take all the blame."" ""The one thing I do know for sure is that we are weaker, divided."" ""Teachers seem to lead toward condemning conservatives and praising Democrats in all different fields and for that reason, I feel isolated from our community and enraged that my opinion is viewed as wrong by some students and by some teachers."" ""I am writing this e-mail so my fellow classmates can live in harmony and so that I do not raise my children in a society that is this divided. I wish that all opinions could be heard to their full extent whether people agree or disagree. It doesn't matter what race, religion, sexuality and/or political belief you come from, a school should be a safe haven for everyone to feel welcome."" ""As of right now, I feel others' beliefs are being imposed on me. I'm the eldest of four boys and my brothers look up to me to set the example."" ""I was doing homework with my youngest brother who at the time was in first grade. I noticed a drawing in his folder. I pulled out this drawing and I was heartbroken. My brother had drawn a picture of President Trump and written, 'Trump should not build the wall.' My seven-year-old brother knows nothing about politics. He knows nothing about the real world. He was being manipulated to belief something he should never even have known about."" ""As a seven-year-old, he should have been focused on when the next time he can play outside or read books, not about politics. Sincerely, Elliott Mores.""

2021-02-03,"TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. Happy Wednesday. On November 22, 1963, a man called Lee Harvey Oswald murdered the President of the United States. There are a lot of questions about what happened, but there was never any question about who Lee Harvey Oswald was. Oswald was a passionate and committed communist. In 1959, he gave up his American passport and defected to the Soviet Union. There, he married a Russian woman and lived in Minsk. Three years later, he returned to this country and immediately began attending rallies in support of Fidel Castro, the Communist leader of Cuba. In the fall of 1963, Oswald traveled to Mexico City and met with KGB agents there. A few months before, in Dallas, he tried to murder General Edwin Walker because Walker had given speeches attacking communism. So, Lee Harvey Oswald never hid his politics not for a moment. He talked incessantly about communism to anyone who would listen. And yet, many Americans never really understood what Lee Harvey Oswald believed, and they didn't understand it because news outlets didn't tell them. Instead, almost immediately, the media began spinning a very different story. President Kennedy, they suggested had been murdered by conservatives, possibly by conservatism itself, by hate, as they often put it. The explanation was never very precise, but the idea was always the same: right-wingers killed Kennedy. The Soviet Union -- naturally a suspect in this crime -- was happy to agree with the assessment. As the Soviet spokesman put it, moral responsibility for the Kennedy assassination lay squarely with, quote: ""Barry Goldwater and other extremists on the right."" In the end, the coordinated lying paid off. A year later, Senator Barry Goldwater lost to the incumbent Democrat Lyndon Johnson in a historically lopsided presidential election. By that point, many voters associated Goldwater with murder. As the decades passed, the media kept repeating this lie. By the 50th anniversary of the Kennedy assassination, ""The New Yorker"" Magazine, was still blaming, quote, ""anti-communism"" for the fact that an avowed communist had murdered the President. Just because it's absurd doesn't mean they won't say with a straight face, and they do. By now, it's likely that most Americans believe that's exactly what happened and why wouldn't they believe it? That's what they've been told. That point is worth ruminating on and remembering. History is a political tool. History is not simply a record of what happened. History is a way to shape the future. History is used to hurt some people and to help other people gain power. History is never neutral. We're watching our own history being written before us right now. Consider this clip. It is from MSNBC last night. In this clip, famous historian Michael Beschloss compares what happened at the Capitol on January 6th to what happened to America on September 11. MICHAEL BESCHLOSS, AMERICAN HISTORIAN: This was a President of the United States inciting an insurrection, a terrorist attack on Congress. We observe 9/11. We remember the fact that there were attacks that landed, one that almost landed, which was an effort to fly an airplane into the Capitol Hill with a lot of Members of Congress. That almost happened. Here is a terrorist attack that did happen. CARLSON: So we observe 9/11, he says; going forward, we must observe January 6th. Maybe we'll need a Memorial on the Mall. As Beschloss has said repeatedly in the last 24 hours, and very pointedly, we must quote, ""never forget."" Now it's true, it is pretty easy to make fun of Michael Beschloss. Beschloss is a historian in the same sense that 7-Eleven is a restaurant. Like a convenience store, Beschloss is everywhere. It could be three in the morning on a cold December night, and you could still pick up a pint of Michael Beschloss, if you needed one. Just don't consume too much of it. It's not nutritious. And yet still, an awful lot of people eat this stuff, and that's the point. Michael Beschloss sells what is called popular history. It is the kind of history that sticks, and that's just the history being assembled in print and on cable news, which at this point, and let's be honest about it, are the media of choice for those of us who lived in a world before the internet, they are media for older people. For Americans under 30, history is written exclusively on social media, and that's where the real demagogues live. Tech platforms are the domain of people for whom factual reality is not even a consideration. It's a completely different way of thinking. Once you've decided that biology itself is not real, you are free from the conventional restraints of reality. At that point, what actually happened in a given place at a given time is totally and completely irrelevant. Ideology is all that matters. Sandy Cortez is a master of this medium of course. Watch her description of the events of January 6th broadcast to kids across the country on Instagram. REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): I jumped into my bathroom and I closed the door. And I just keep hearing, bang, bang, bang. I opened the door, when all of a sudden I hear that whoever was trying to get inside, got into my office, and I just hear, ""Where is she? Where is she?"" And this was the moment where I thought everything was over. CARLSON: So we played clips like that for you before and we've always made fun of them. There she is, again, defender of the common man yammering on about the only subjects he really cares about -- herself. Wallowing around in Lake Me like it's interesting to anyone, but her -- narcissism on parade, the perfect symbol of a culture dying from self-involvement. We said that before and we have laughed as we did. But actually, it's not funny. People will believe this crap, some already do. Anyone who was physically present at the Capitol that day knows it's ridiculous. There were no rioters in Sandy Cortez's hallway. Trump voters weren't trying to kill her, neither were other U.S. senators. A lot of the rioters were angry at Mitch McConnell than they were at any Democrat. To some extent, what you saw on January 6th was an intra-party struggle. Not all of it, but some of it. An act of mindless destruction aimed at Republican leaders, borne of long simmering frustration. The people who run the Republican Party don't care about the people who elect them. That has long been true, Republican voters finally figured it out. It's one of the main things they learned during the Trump years, and on January 6th, they exploded. Lindsey Graham was likely in graver danger than Sandy Cortez or Ilhan Omar. They were literally calling poor Mike Pence's name. He didn't do anything. They were furious with him. Now, that's not a defense of anyone's behavior, much less defense of rioting, which unlike the other channels, we do not support and will never support. It's not even an ideological point. It's just true. That's what happened. But at this point, the truth doesn't matter. What matters is, who gets to write the history of what happens? Who gets to define what the truth is? They're the ones who will control the future. That's why they're doing it. There's a reason that within hours, Democrats began describing the riot as a racial attack. It was confusing to hear that at first, if you watched it and knew what happened, we were completely confused. Awful as it was, there was nothing racial about what happened that day. Claiming otherwise is absurd. It's a fantasy. It's a lie. But no one pushed back against that lie, so they kept repeating it. Now, weeks later, it is the accepted version of what happened. Powerful lawmakers just say it from the House floor like it is fact, like it's been proven in some objective inquiry and everyone knows it's true. REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): America has been through a Civil War, World Wars, a Great Depression, pandemics, McCarthyism, and now, a Trumpist and white nationalist insurrection. CARLSON: White nationalist insurrection. Again, it was awful, it was not that. But you've got to ask yourself, why are they claiming that it was that? Think about it? You know the answer. Everyone knows the answer. Yet, almost everyone is too cowardly at this point to say it out loud, and the answer is this. They're saying that, despite the fact they know it isn't true so they can lump you in with the people who broke into the Capitol and punish you for crimes you did not commit and never supported. If what happened on January 6th was a riot and it was, then we can arrest the rioters and punish them and we should. If what happened on January 6th was an insurrection, however, if it was a failed revolution, an attempted coup, then it's something else entirely. If it's that, then we need a military response. We need a new war against our own population and not surprisingly, that's exactly what they are calling for. ( BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) ROBERT GRENIER, FORMER C.I.A. OFFICER: Even at the seeming height of the crisis immediately after 9/11, there really weren't that many members of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, and the thrust of our campaign there was yes, to hunt down al-Qaeda, but primarily to remove the supportive environment in which they were able to flourish, and that meant fighting the Taliban. And I think that is the heart of what we need to deal with here. Hunting down people who are -- who are criminals. ( END AUDIO CLIP) CARLSON: ""Hunt them down like al-Qaeda."" And to be completely clear, we're not overstaying this. We are not hysterical, we are just close listeners. By them, he means Americans who were nowhere near the Capitol on January 6, had no role in what happened that day and didn't support it. That's the assessment from a former C.I.A. official who spent years hunting al-Qaeda in the Middle East. No one in Washington appears to think this kind of talk is alarming in a formerly peaceful Republic like ours. Just today, Senator Mitch McConnell, the leader sent out a tweet blasting Vladimir Putin for some misdeed or other. In the U.S. Senate, Russia is still the real threat, not quite as upset about China somehow. But what McConnell didn't mention and almost never does are his own voters, the ones now being reclassified as al-Qaeda terrorists and treated accordingly. On Monday, ""The Washington Examiner"" which claims to be a right of center publication, whatever that means at this point, ran a piece by a former C.I.A. officer called Kevin Carroll. According to Kevin Carroll, quote, ""We saw five dead in the January 6 attempted coup d'etat."" Now Carroll didn't explain who exactly those five people were, or how exactly they died. It would be nice to know that, but facts were not the point. The point was that this was an attempted coup d'etat, and the U.S. government needs to act accordingly. Again, we're quoting here, quote: ""We defeated al-Qaeda and can do the same thing to the fascist thugs who attacked our democracy last month, but only if we take similar hard measures against the enemy within."" ""Treating Americans like al-Qaeda, the enemy within,"" apparently that's the new conservative position on the riots of January 6th, and why wouldn't it be the position of everyone in this country? Because that's the history they are writing and we're letting them, but we should be prepared for the consequences of that history. Victor Davis Hanson is an actual historian, so we thought it would be interesting to get his view of all of this. He joins us tonight. Professor, thanks so much for coming on. VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION: Thank you. CARLSON: You're watching this history get written. What's your view of it? HANSON: Well, it is mythography or psychodrama. Beschloss didn't give any quantification. He says, you know, it's a tragedy. Five people died in a two-hour riot and that's somehow comparable with 3,000 being incinerated in 20 acres of ash in New York or a hundred days of torching a Federal Courthouse or police precinct, 700 policemen injured, 40 dead, $4 billion or $5 billion in damage. So the historian has to quantify things or give evidence. Where is the quotation that Donald Trump uttered that is cause and effect that caused that? He doesn't do any of that. These are crises that are not supposed to go to waste, and I'm quoting directly now, as you know from Rahm Emanuel or Gavin Newsom or Hillary Clinton. The left sees a Katrina, for example, a tragedy as an indictment. They use the word systemic or root causes or deep that indicts all of America and prove that George Bush is a racist and has to go. Or they see, they can even make them up with Jussie Smollett or the Duke lacrosse, the Virginia fraternity so-called rape, the Covington kids, these show that there is systemic racism, and misogyny and homophobia. Sometimes they are real tragedies, Michael Brown or George Floyd or this Capitol riot, but they work the details and so they turn a tragedy into all policemen are racist, and therefore you must do the following, which leads us finally, Tucker, why do they do it? I think one reason is they don't have confidence that the progressive agenda appeals to 50 percent of the people, but under the terms and times and errors of hysteria, and fright and terror, it does. So they push through that agenda. We've had all these Executive Orders. Tucker, we haven't discussed them. We're all talking about sedition and Civil War while Joe Biden is rewriting the Constitution and the last four years through Executive Order. The other final thing, Tucker is, they always play offense. It's like a teenage abusive relationship with a teenager with the parent. You did this and you did this and you do this. And finally the parent says, okay, what do I have to do? But -- and that's when we have to impeach the President. Maybe we should vote for impeachment. Maybe we should buy into the Russian collusion, will that satisfy you? And of course it won't satisfy you because there's nothing there. It's an abusive, calibrated act and they interpret unfortunately, you know, balance and outreach is not as magnanimity to be reciprocated, but as weakness to be exploited. And it doesn't stop until you say you know what, call me a racist or homophobe, a protectionist -- anything you want, but let's look at the facts and I'm not going to be bullied. You made a really good point about the past, that's right out of Orwell, the people who control the past and can create the future and you control the past and the present and that's what they're doing. CARLSON: And the rest of us are allowing it as if we've never seen this before. HANSON: We are. CARLSON: We know what is going on, and of course we do. It's not about the next election. They've raised the stakes. I appreciate you're putting that in context for us, Professor Victor Davis Hanson. HANSON: Thank you. CARLSON: Appreciate it. So as if this moment couldn't get more peak Orwell than it already is, ""The New York Times"" has come up with plan for a new Ministry of Truth, for real, a reality czar -- because they are now in charge of reality. Mark Steyn is here to tell us what this might mean, a man who spent a lot of time fighting for his freedom to speak plainly and honestly. We'll be right back. CARLSON: You've got to wonder why people go into journalism. It doesn't pay well, nobody likes you. It's kind of a slog. It's dying, but people do it anyway. Why is that? And of course, the answer is obvious -- for power. You get influence. You can tell people what to do. Those creepy kids over at CNN. Losers. Always trying to put people off the internet, it makes them feel big. That's the whole point. Well, over at ""The New York Times"" they have decided they need more power. In fact, they need a Ministry of Truth that they are charge of. So they sent a journalist to Silicon Valley this week to rustle up some new ideas on how to control what the rest of us say and think, and here's what they came up with, and we're quoting. ""Several experts recommend the Biden administration put together a cross agency taskforce to tackle disinformation and domestic extremism, which would be led by something like a reality czar."" A reality czar. So ""The New York Times"" and the Biden administration are now in charge of reality. Now the paper in a rare flash of awareness concedes this sounds, quote, ""a little dystopian."" But the paper doesn't answer the most basic question, which is, what is this reality the reality czar will promote? And you know exactly. The reality czar will promote their realities, the ones we're always hearing about. That George Floyd didn't actually die of a fentanyl overdose, no. The reality that the police officers commit genocide. The reality that eight year old boys should take puberty blockers. The reality that women -- most women would much prefer to work for an investment bank instead of raising their own kids, that abortion is liberation. That it is deeply fulfilling to live alone in an apartment with your cats. That hedge funds are the real drivers of this economy. Those are their realities and now they're yours. It's mandatory and not just yours, but the rest of the world. It is now the policy of the State Department which is to say the U.S. government that any time another media outlet in another country expresses a reality they don't like, we're in favor of shutting it down. Just this morning, the State Department explicitly endorsed state censorship of media organizations, any ones that anger our permanent political class here. The U.S. Embassy in Kiev, Ukraine celebrated the Ukrainian government's crackdown, banishment, censorship of television networks, domestic television networks that they don't like. They oppose the state, they got rid of them. This is our position now, the U.S. government: ""The U.S. supports Ukraine's efforts yesterday to counter Russia's malign influence. We must all work together to prevent disinformation from being deployed as a weapon in an info war against sovereign states."" Oh, wow. So we now support shutting down opposition TV stations if they don't toe the government line. I thought we were spreading freedom around the world? No. No longer. Our new export is preventing disinformation. Now, if that sounds familiar to you, it's because it's the very same justification that the Governor of Illinois, JB Pritzker, just used to deploy soldiers to Washington, D.C. indefinitely. And again, we want to be clear, the television stations, the Ukrainian government just banned were Ukrainian television stations. Their crime was opposing the pro-Western political class in Ukraine. Our political leaders applauded their censorship without thinking twice about it. In fact, I'm sure we will be attacked for calling this into question. If they can promote it there, why can't they do it here? It's happening in Canada, also part of the Anglosphere. It's about to be law. That country's Heritage Minister has promised new online hate legislation this winter. Now that legislation would be based on a Canadian Supreme Court decision that held this, we want to quote it for you: ""Not all truthful statements must be free from restriction."" Oh, so you thought that truth was a defense. Oh, no. Just because what you say is accurate, defensible on the merits, on the facts, doesn't mean you're allowed to say it if it hurts the people in power, so the mask is off. They are admitting what this is really about, which is not empowering you or any oppressed group, but keeping the airways free from criticism of them. Censorship always hurts the weak, it always helps the strong. That has never changed and it is accelerating. Mark Steyn has been on to this for quite some time. He was personally involved in a free speech fight in Canada. He is a bestselling author, of course. He has got a global perspective on what we're watching tonight, so we're happy to have him. Mark, what do you think is going on here? MARK STEYN, AUTHOR AND COLUMNIST: Well, you mentioned my own experience in Canada, that's about a decade ago and with the help of a very dogged eared backbencher because the so-called conservative government up there was rather scared of this matter. So a backbencher and I, we managed to actually get that law repealed, the hate speech law repealed, and I don't think we could do that today. I testified to the House of Commons in Ottawa last year, I believe it was about this bill there they are anxious to bring in today. And today, the difference is that the general climate of free speech in Canada, the United States, the U.K., Australia, and Europe, pretty much everywhere throughout the Western world is worse than it was a decade ago and between this malign alliance, in fact, a merger, certainly in Washington, between Big Tech and the state, we are moving into a literally Orwellian world where phrases out of Orwell's 1984, he uses the phrase ""reality control."" As you've just said, ""The New York Times"" now is in favor of establishing a Federal agency of reality control under a so-called reality czar. These people are so un-self-aware, and, frankly, so illiterate that they don't even realize these are tired ideas that they are lifting from a 70-year-old indictment of the totalitarian state. CARLSON: I wonder if that book is even read any more or if it is allowed? I mean, how long before Orwell himself is banned? Sincere question. STEYN: Oh, yes, I don't -- I don't think there's any doubt about that. I think one thing that -- I mean, to go back to when I got that Canadian law repealed. One thing that's changed since then is that today, free speech is openly mocked as some kind of right-wing fetish. On the other side, they regard an ever expanding range of topics as there being a correct view, and once that view has been established, there is no need for further discussion on it. So whether it is climate change, or Islam, or same sex marriage, or transgender participation in sports, there's a settled view and once we've settled it, we need no longer debate it. And the problem with that is that there's an ever expanding range of issues that are added to that list to the situation we now face in the United States, whereas in fact, disagreeing with the official state position on for example, some new coronavirus that nobody had heard of a year ago and nobody knows anything about, but just disagreeing with officialdom now is increasingly forbidden. That's why this weasel phrase, disinformation. What's the information you're dissing? It's official information. It's Ministry of Information information, and the idea that now the official version cannot be contradicted is widely accepted even by contemptible media figures, like ""The New York Times"" and that Stelter guy over at CNN who are openly on censorship's side. CARLSON: Openly, and of course, doing the bidding of the powerful as all sensors are. Mark Steyn, it is great to see tonight. Thank you. STEYN: Thanks a lot, Tucker. CARLSON: So as one of his first acts as President, as the President of science, a representative of the party of science, Joe Biden, rejected officially the idea of biological sex. Now, this isn't just like a boutique issue, it has real world implications. One of them is on women's sports. We're going to talk to one athlete whose had enough of competing against biological men. It's hurt her. She joins us straight ahead. CARLSON: As one of his first acts as President, Joe Biden signed an Executive Order that makes it the official policy of the United States government that biological sex is not real. We're starting to see the effects of that or there will be many. FOX's Trace Gallagher has the beginning of that story for us tonight. Hey, Trace. TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF BREAKING NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Tucker. In the 2019 Connecticut Indoor Track and Field state championships, Selina Soule needed to place in the top two in the 55-meter dash to move on to the finals, she placed third. The athletes who came in first and second are transgender, born males who now identify as females. Now, Selina and two other female athletes have filed a lawsuit alleging that it is unfair for girls to compete against athletes who have physical advantages, or as Alliance Defending Freedom wrote quoting here, ""Allowing boys to compete in girls' sports reverses nearly 50 years of advances for women under this law. We shouldn't force these young women to be spectators in their own sport."" But the transgender athletes say this. Watch. TRANSGENDER ATHLETE: We run track because that's where we feel most comfortable. That's our sport. We are female, so we wouldn't run on any other team, but the female team. TRANSGENDER ATHLETE: Are we not human like everybody else? Am I just some it or -- I don't know -- my life doesn't matter. How do you think we feel? We go through this every day and we're brave enough to keep on going. GALLAGHER: Though many believe bravery runs two ways, saying those who dare to question whether biological males should be allowed to compete against females are ridiculed and bullied like Martina Navratilova found out a few years ago, and critics point out this debate will only get more intense now that President Biden signed an Executive Order saying schools should allow transgender athletes to participate in the sport of their gender identity -- Tucker. CARLSON: Trace Gallagher, bravery runs both ways. Wise point. Appreciate it. Well, as you just heard Selina Soule is a track athlete in Connecticut. She has been forced to compete against biological males. Kristen Waggoner is an attorney at the Alliance Defending Freedom, they join us both tonight. Thank you for joining us. Selina, first to you. There's been a lot of attention given to the transgender athletes and their heroic behavior. I'm wondering about your side of this. Why do you think it's unfair that you should have to compete against biological males on the track? SELINA SOULE, TRACK ATHLETE: Thank you for having me on, again, Tucker. There are great biological differences between a man's woman and a female's body, and that's why sports have always been segregated and that's why it should continue to be segregated to protect women and to give them a fair chance at sports. CARLSON: It seem -- that's what would seem like probably a pretty widely held position. It's been the position of people for, you know, all recorded history. You've said this out loud, what kind of reaction have you received? SOULE: I have gotten a lot of support, but to me, any of the feedback that I get doesn't matter too much, because I know that what I'm fighting for is right and I will continue to fight it for as long as I have to. CARLSON: Kristen, what does this fight look like? Is there any chance in the wake of this Executive Order that these rules can be overturned and we can return to reality? KRISTEN WAGGONER, ALLIANCE DEFENDING FREEDOM ATTORNEY: There is a. chance it's an abuse of power, and it violates federal law, and it will be challenged. But I would encourage Americans to start standing up on these issues, because it's our women and girls that are hurt the most when the law doesn't recognize reality, biological differences. CARLSON: So why -- I mean, why aren't people standing up in the face of this as their own daughters are suffering as a result of it, do you think Kristen? WAGGONER: Well, I think Trace highlighted that they are being bullied, that the retaliation, the death threats, the name calling that occurs, and what this is about is whether feelings and metaphysical claims can trump reality. Yes, it's about sports. It's about the benefits of sports to women. But it's about a whole lot more than that, too. We're seeing not only women and girls suffer as a result of this ideology, but millions of students, faculty members and healthcare providers are being bullied into silence over this issue. CARLSON: That's right. I mean, this has a lot of implications. This is just one. Selina, you are a female athlete and an accomplished one. You're the sort of person we used to celebrate. Female athletics was empowering to women and girls. That's why we have Title 9. Why do you think more people aren't taking your side in this? SOULE: I think most people are afraid of the backlash and retaliation that comes with speaking out about a controversial issue like this is. CARLSON: Yes. Yes. Do you wish more people would speak up on your behalf? On behalf of other female athletes? SOULE: I do wish that more people would speak up because the more voices we have fighting this, the better chance we have to get a solution that we enjoy. CARLSON: Yes, of course, it's not -- I mean, I think people become convinced that commonsense and reality are somehow hated. They are embarrassed to say true things out loud. You're not and I appreciate that. Selina and Kristen, thank you both. SOULE: Thank you for having me. WAGGONER: Thank you. CARLSON: So John Kerry is our new climate czar. He is still flying around on private planes. You're not allowed to do that. The question is why? Why does John Kerry get to fly on a private plane emitting more carbon than entire villages in Africa, as he complains about your carbon emissions? Well, there's a reason, actually, and he explained it himself. We have the footage. It has been buried for more than a year. We're going to show it to you on the channel where free speech lives, FOX News. We will be right back. CARLSON: Former Senator John Kerry is your new climate czar. Joe Biden hired him the other day. A lot of czars all of a sudden, so we want to keep them separate. The climate czar is very different from a reality czar, which apparently we're also getting. The climates czar is not worried about reality or science for that matter, any of that. The climate czar fights climate change, and if facts or commonsense get in the way of that, the climate czar will fight those, too. It is the perfect role for John Kerry. John Kerry used about his entire life to take on global warming by contributing as much to global warming as he possibly can. Over the past year, to name just one among many examples, John Kerry's private jet, yes, he has one has spent at least 20 hours in the air, emitting in the process more than 100 metric tons of carbon emissions, much more than you will emit in a lifetime since you don't have a private jet. John Kerry is the kind of leader who leads by negative examples. Well, in 2019, the world finally recognized John Kerry's sacrifice, his enduring commitment to doing precisely what he wants while preventing you from doing the same. John Kerry was given in recognition of this, something called the Arctic Circle Award. That award recognizes his efforts to quote, ""tackle environmental matters."" Naturally, John Kerry flew all the way to Iceland, that's 3,000 miles away on his private jet to accept this honor. In his acceptance speech, John Kerry made it very clear that people like John Kerry make him very angry. In order to fight climate change, John Kerry said, we need to do exactly the opposite of what John Kerry himself is doing at the moment. JOHN KERRY, U.S. SPECIAL PRESIDENTIAL ENVOY FOR CLIMATE: People are dying around the world because of climate change. I see it my country. Floods in mid part of our country that wiped out farms, fires even now in California, mudslides that swallowed up whole homes and people. I get angry when I look at what public responsibility is supposed to be and I don't see people doing it. CARLSON: There are mudslides and floods and fires, therefore, I must have more power and if you don't give it to me, I will be angry. And to prove that point, John Kerry will personally cause as many mudslides and floods and fires as it takes to wake you up to this problem. That's the cross he is willing to bear. Any questions? Well, at the time, no one had any questions, actually, they never do. No one in the American media asks questions or thought that speech was weird in any way. But back in 2019, one journalist in Iceland, not yet brainwashed, did have a question. He asked: why did John Kerry fly all the way to Iceland on a private plane? Isn't that a little hypocritical? Now, to our knowledge, no one covered John Kerry's response, at the time, it was completely buried. We have it now. You're going to want to see it. This is John Kerry's response. KERRY: It's the only choice for somebody like me who is traveling the world to win this battle. I believe the time it takes me to get somewhere, I can't sail across the ocean, I have to fly to meet with people and get things done. CARLSON: ""It's the only choice for someone like me."" It's the only choice for someone like me -- what of a 12,000-square foot house on the water in Nantucket. It's the only choice for someone like me, not a choice, you're allowed to have. None of the rules apply to the people in charge, obviously. The people in charge are important, you are insignificant and that's why corporations: Amazon, Microsoft, Apple are seeing record profits right now even as your life falls apart, even if you run a small business, you get arrested for trying to make a living. This is just standard in the climate movement. They don't have any problem with it at all. John Kerry's answer or any of this behavior, because for them, it's not really about the environment. None of these people, none of these people, the ones yelling about ""There is no Planet B"" know anything about nature. They don't go outside. They couldn't name three bird species. They don't know deciduous from a conifer. They are completely cut off from nature. They hate nature. They're at war with it. But there is one exception, one principled voice in the environmental movement. We reached out today to get her reaction to John Kerry's speech in Iceland. And again, no one has reported on this. Here exclusively, if you can handle it is Greta Thunberg's response to John Kerry. GRETA THUNBERG, ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVIST: You all come to us young people for hope. How dare you? You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. CARLSON: Yes, you go Greta Thunberg. You tell that John Kerry. He is wrecking your childhood. Well, you hear the term systemic racism, like about every 20 minutes at this point. Activists against our national television, of course, they're in your H.R. Department, they are teaching your kids in elementary school and they're pushing what at its core is an absurd lie, that America is an inherently racist place. Don't tell that to the people who are moving here from Africa. They don't know yet. When everyone is lying, it's easy to forget that institutional racism actually does exist, however. And as you'd expect, institutional racism exists in our institutions, particularly in our most prestigious universities. That's really where it flourishes, as all bad things do. These schools have raised blinded missions for alums, for rich people who donate a lot of money, especially for famous actresses, people with the last name ""Cuomo."" They get in. But in the name of equity, all other students are sorted by skin color because that's not racist or anything. Well of course, it is racist, it is the definition of it. So last year the Justice Department focused in on Yale University's decision to adopt an explicit racial caste system in its admissions. After looking at all the data, the D.O.J. found that -- and we are quoting: ""For the great majority of applicants of Asian-American and white prospective students have a one-tenth to one-fourth the likelihood of admission as African-American applicants with comparable academic credentials."" And according to the Department of Justice, quote: ""Yale rejects the scores of Asian-American and white applicants each year based on their race."" So if you're against racism, you've got to be against that because it's just prima facie wrong. It's too unfair, it is racist, obviously. But not according to the new administration. Today, Biden's administration dropped that lawsuit. Yale, of course, was gratified, one of the Biden kids went to Yale Law School probably on his merits. Yale is very happy to continue to discriminate against students. But this won't end with Yale as we've reported, Joe Biden has nominated a woman to head the Civil Rights Division at your Justice Department called Kristen Clarke. Kristen Clarke is way out of the mainstream on these questions in a very dark place actually. Kristen Clarke has written that black people could be genetically superior to other races. If that doesn't make the hair on your arm stand up, any claim that any race is inherently superior to any other should make you really nervous. We're against that for the record. If Clarke is confirmed, quote, ""institutional racism"" won't be something that D.O.J. just ignores in court, it will be something the D.O.J. dictates and no one will stop them. Well, that same Justice Department is now prosecuting a journalist for mocking the Democratic Party on Twitter. He faces 10 years in jail for offending them. Andy McCarthy joins us next for a sober assessment of the case against this man. We'll be right back. CARLSON: The Department of Justice is now prosecuting a journalist called Doug Mackey for making memes on the internet. Prosecutors tell us that Mackey should go to jail for a decade because his memes spread misinformation about the 2016 election. As a pretext, D.O.J. is using a law that criminalizes kidnapping, voter intimidation, things he didn't do. We'd like a sober assessment of this case because it matters for the whole country. It's a precedent, they all are. Andy McCarthy is the man to do that. He's a former U.S. Attorney. We're happy to have him tonight to assess. Andy, thanks for coming on. What do you make of the argument the D.O.J. is making, and should the rest of us be worried about it? ANDY MCCARTHY, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: Well, I'd like to just say it's a ridiculous case, Tucker, but actually, it turns out to be a dangerous one in the end. I mean, basically, you have a guy who is putting out memes with some misinformation in it. They'd like to be able to charge him with fraud, but they can't because it's not a Federal fraud. So what they've done is trivialize something that's a very serious problem, which is voters who get threatened with physical harm to prevent them from voting. CARLSON: Right. Yes. MCCARTHY: And obviously, that doesn't apply to this situation at all. So it's really like a toe in the water for the F.B.I. in the end, to manage communications and election campaigns. And, you know, I think we've seen in the last few years how well the F.B.I. is involved in our elections and our politics has worked out. CARLSON: Well, it's a disaster, and you just pointed out some really legitimately scary implications of this. There are a lot of sober, smart, patriotic people at the F.B.I., why would they -- and the D.O.J. for that matter, I have to believe, why would they take a case like this? Why would they do this? MCCARTHY: You know, I think, Tucker, that it's part of what you're going to see, it's a general theme that's running through all of the things that the Biden administration is doing. I think you're going to see a lot of it from their Justice Department. These are progressive narratives. Basically, what they want you to believe is there are, you know, Trump Twitter trolls, and white supremacists who are out there, you know, undermining American life at every turn and corrupting our election process, and this is just another piece of it. CARLSON: It does seem like the kind of thing that we should push back on as hard as we possibly can because once this precedent is set, how is this America in the way that we've experienced it? MCCARTHY: You're right, and it's -- you know, it's a very short step from saying the F.B.I. should monitor information about how you can vote to what you can say in an election campaign. And again, I just think the government monitoring this stuff ought to alarm everyone. CARLSON: Yes. That's the word from Andy McCarthy. Unlike us, not a hothead, a sober assessor of the law. We're glad you came on tonight. Andy McCarthy, thank you. MCCARTHY: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: Before we go tonight. We're hearing some things not clear if they're true, but we are hearing them about the future of the Dwarf King, the leader over at CNN and that may be uncertain at this hour. That could have big implications for the American news business, obviously. We'll find out more and you'll be the first to know. We'll be back tomorrow, 8:00 p.m., the shows that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. Have a great night. Here is Sean Hannity. SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: All right, that's like a conspiracy theory. Who is the King? Who is this guy? I have no idea who you're talking about. CARLSON: The Dwarf King at CNN, the man who from his lair, atop CNN Center sends his minions out to crush free speech, wherever it emerges. HANNITY: All right. I've got to figure out a code. I'll get there, Tucker, thank you. I'm teasing. Thank you. Good show. Classification"
2021-01-25,"TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening, and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. Happy Monday. Even his allies concede the Joe Biden isn't as quick as he used to be. It now takes him an hour and a half to watch ""60 Minutes."" But to be fair, Biden's administration may be the fastest in history. We are less than a week in and the White House has already ended immigration enforcement, sent American troops into armed conflict, crippled the last remaining independent sector of our economy, and officially for the first time in human history, denied the biological reality of sex differences. That'll happened in three and a half business days. Amazing. Google is getting its money's worth. Now, Congress is about to get involved in changing this country. Democrats control the entire legislative branch of government, so this should be a swift process, too. Their priority is House Resolution number one. It's called that because it is the first bill in the legislative pipeline. So what exactly is in that bill? It's possible that CNN hasn't brought you all the details yet. They're too busy trying to save the country from forbidden ideas and internet chat rooms. They're on the case there. As for the actual legislation pending before Congress, we will let Nancy Pelosi herself explain what's in it. Here's what she said about H.R. 1 back in October. REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): We have plenty of work to do in the Joe Biden administration. We're going to build the infrastructure of America in a green way. We're going to make sure healthcare is available to all Americans, lower the cost of prescription drugs. We're going to have H.R. 1 -- H.R. 1 right off the bat be about cleaner government so that we can reduce the role of big dark, special interest money. CARLSON: H.R. 1 is all about that big, dark, special interest money. Scary. But you have to wonder why Nancy Pelosi is still using the term ""dark"" as a euphemism for bad, but whatever, it is Nancy Pelosi, so we can be sure it's not racism. Nancy Pelosi is a good person unlike you. The real question is how the party of ruthless corporate monopolies gets away with fake populist talking points like that. ""We need cleaner government,"" shriek the puppets of Silicon Valley. The answer, of course is they get away with it because no one stops them. This is the, quote, ""For the People Act"" we're talking about here. It's for the people, so shut up. What exactly does the Democratic Party intend to do for the people? Well, if you guessed enshrine their own rule by force forever, you win today's Daily Double. I'll take authoritarian political movements for a thousand, Alex. Good job. The For the People Act is the foundation of the Democratic Party's strategy to control the Federal government well into your grandchildren's middle age. Take a look at it. Like most revolutionary documents, it's not a very exciting read. Nothing in it sounds especially radical at first until you think about it. The bill begins by declaring that contrary to Article I of the United States Constitution, Congress has, quote, ""The ultimate supervisory power over Federal elections."" That's a big change. Under our current law, states get to decide how much fraud they will tolerate. Florida requires you to show photo identification in order to vote. California just wants you to vote Democrat. If H.R. one passes, all 50 states will be California. The entire country will have ballot harvesting and mail-in voting. Think about that. On January 6th, we had a riot at the U.S. Capitol. Why did that happen? It happened because millions of American voters were convinced that the last election was not fair. Where did they get that idea? Well, it wasn't simply because the last President told them so, you're hearing that now as if they are animals who take commands and do what they're told, but they're not animals, they are people. They are American citizens who can see what's happening and come to their own conclusions about it. They saw the radical increase in mail-in voting, millions did and it corroded their faith and the public's faith in our systems of election. They were enraged by that and some of them exploded. According to Democrats, the lesson of that terrible day is that we need more of the corrupt policies that caused it in the first place. We need more mail-in voting. We need more ballot harvesting, more corruption. That will unite the country. We're not overstating any of this. H.R. 1 would literally enshrine fraud. Here's a direct quote from that legislation. Quote, ""A state may not require an individual to provide any form of identification as a condition of obtaining an absentee ballot, any form of identification, no identification whatsoever, nor can signatures be validated."" Here's another direct quote from H.R. 1 quote, ""A state may not require notarization or witness signature or other formal authentication (other than the voter's word for it) as a condition of a staining or casting an absentee ballot."" Under H.R. 1, paid political operatives could freely go house to house, apartment to apartment collecting unknown thousands of ballots, then dump them all at a ballot drop box. And no one would have any idea if those ballots had been tampered with at any point along the way, nor would there be any way to prove it if they had been tampered with. And by the way, H.R. 1 also makes it harder for election observers to file complaints about any of this because complaining is racist. A system like that is suicidal for a democracy. No other free country would tolerate it. France and Canada don't tolerate it. They have banned mail-in ballots. They don't want fraud. By the way, now, there's amazon.com. It's a real company. Jeff Bezos who owns it is strongly for mail-in voting when mail-in voting allows his parties to take control of everything. You're a bigot if you oppose that. But when it comes to Union elections in his own company, elections that might require Jeff Bezos to pay his long suffering workers decent wages and benefits, Jeff Bezos is totally opposed to it. Amazon is fighting mail-in balloting in its union election in Alabama right now; amazon.com's position is that an election decided by mail-in ballots wouldn't be -- and we're quoting, ""valid or fair."" When it's their power at stake, Democrats have a totally different position. And that's true in California right now. You may have heard there was a recall effort underway in that state. Voters are trying to boot their comically incompetent Governor, Gavin Newsom. More than a million people have signed on so far to that effort. But it's not so easy to get it done because Democrats are requiring in- person signatures for those petitions. Suddenly, they're very worried about voter fraud. You should know this is not hypocrisy. Republicans often call it hypocrisy, but it is not; it is far more profound than that. Democrats don't care about hypocrisy. They don't mind if they're caught breaking their own rules. They're not offended by double standards. They want power. This is a power grab. That's all it is. And you're complaining about it means nothing to them. If you needed more evidence of that -- as if you needed more evidence -- consider new legislation from Congresswoman Stephanie Murphy. She's a Democrat from Orlando, Murphy has proposed a bill that would ban anyone with the wrong opinions from having a significant job in the Federal government. Believe forbidden things and you don't get a security clearance. You can't work here. Murphy's bill would require Federal investigators to ask all applicants whether they had quote, "" ... associated with or knowingly engaged in activities conducted by an organization or movement that spreads conspiracy theories and false information about the United States government,"" end quote. Wait a second? Conspiracy theories and false information about the United States government? Whoa, sounds like these people could be in trouble. REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): You can see evidence in plain sight on the issue of collusion. So there's clear evidence on the issue of collusion and this adds to that body of evidence. And there is significant evidence of collusion. There is ample evidence and indeed there is -- of collusion of people in the Trump campaign with the Russians. I think there's plenty of evidence of collusion or conspiracy. All of this is evidence of collusion. There is significant evidence, much of it in the public domain on the issue of collusion. CARLSON: Just kidding. The people who spent years peddling ludicrous conspiracy theories, disproven factually, theories that Vladimir Putin secretly controlled the Federal government, those people will be fine, because at this point, that would include pretty much everyone currently in power. Yes, they were knee deep in conspiracy theories that actually hurt our country in measurable ways, but this legislation isn't designed to punish them. Just the opposite. This legislation is designed to protect them from your criticism. Under Stephanie Murphy's bill, anyone who criticizes Stephanie Murphy could be punished. Oh, makes sense now? Now, you'd think all this might raise some eyebrows among traditional civil liberties people, civil liberties folks, as they call themselves. Come on, now? It's 2021. The media love laws like this. Laws like this are aimed directly at the media's sworn archenemies, people who went to state schools and other undesirables. Listen as the geniuses explain how the single biggest threat to this country isn't Chinese hegemony, or even the coming hyperinflation, pretty much a certainty now, which was a hundred percent caused by elite mismanagement of our economy. But no, let's not talk about that. The real threat is a forbidden idea. It's something called QAnon. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Next, what to do about QAnon and it's droves of loyal followers? Is it too little too late to bring our loved ones back to reality? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Many of those who believe the totally unfounded conspiracies and prophecies of QAnon expected January 20th to be judgment day. PAMELA BROWN, CNN ANCHOR: As far right figures and QAnon conspiracy theorists are joined by Trump supporters who believe the election was stolen. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: QAnon is better viewed as an on ramp to various different extremism circles. THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, OP-ED COLUMNIST, ""THE NEW YORK TIMES"": How many people in the country have been marinated in these conspiracy theories, QAnon craziness and it is frightening. CARLSON: Oh, Mr. Tom Friedman thinks this is all pretty frightening, and he is right, but not as usual for the reasons he thinks. We're watching a profound change taking place in American society. That's happening very fast. The stakes could not be higher. There is a clear line between democracy and tyranny, between self-government and dictatorship, and here's what that line is. That line is your conscience. They cannot cross that. Government has every right to tell you what to do. Controlling the behavior of citizens is one of the basic prerogatives of any organized societies when we have it. Government can try to prevent you from committing murder, or rape, or from speeding or jaywalking. That's all allowed, it's legitimate. But no democratic government can ever tell you what to think. Your mind belongs to you. It is yours and yours alone. Once politicians attempt to control what you believe, they are no longer politicians, they are by definition dictators. And if they succeed in controlling what you believe, you are no longer a citizen. You are not a free man, you are a slave. So yes, Tom Friedman, this is frightening. It's everywhere, all of a sudden. No one is pushing back. Instead, they have all -- almost every one of them join the mob of sensors, hysterics and Jacobin destroyers, all working on behalf of entrenched power to take total control of everything. Overstatement? No, it's not. Their new idea is that this channel shouldn't be allowed. Now, they're not arguing that FOX News is inaccurate and dishonest and you shouldn't watch it. They're arguing that you shouldn't be able to watch FOX News because FOX News should be eliminated by force. A few days ago, a former ""New York Times"" columnist called Anand Giridharadas posted this question on Twitter quote, ""Should FOX News be allowed to exist?"" ""No,"" he quickly concluded, "" ... FOX News, 'shouldn't be legal.'"" No one online seemed especially surprised by this view. Among a certain group, it is a gathering consensus. CNN certainly agrees with it. CNN is our direct competitor, of course. So you might imagine they would recuse themselves from this conversation, oh, but just the opposite. CNN is staring down the barrel of some pretty lean years, ratings wise, now that their reason for existing has departed for Mar-a-Lago. They would love one less news channel on the dial. So over the weekend, the Dwarf King summoned a pair of his most pliable minions up from the cellar, and turn them loose to explain that actually, allowing people to watch what they want to watch on TV is a massive threat to democracy. BRIAN STELTER, CNN CHIEF MEDIA CORRESPONDENT: President Biden seems to understand that right wing radicalization is a real problem. His team seems to recognize how FOX and Facebook and QAnon fantasies and all of that has caused the separate realities in the United States. JIM ACOSTA, CNN ANCHOR AND CHIEF DOMESTIC CORRESPONDENT: And it remains a threat to our democracy. It is the reason -- it is the reason why there were hundreds of Trump supporters storming the Capitol on January 6th, and until that poison, that toxin is drained from the national political discourse in this country, Brian, I do think that these forces represent a potential existential threat to this country. CARLSON: Oh, it's existential. It is existential. It is existential. Now, you should know that no one on CNN has ever been asked to spell or define the word existential. The day that happens is the day they stopped using the word. Instead, they called in reinforcements from Jeff Bezos, who also has expressed interest in buying CNN because of course, Bezos's employee, Margaret Sullivan at ""The Washington Post"" wrote an entire column about how the continued existence of a single news channel that at times disagrees with all the other news channels is -- you guessed it -- a threat to democracy. That's too much choice. That's not democratic. Quote, ""Corporations that advertise on FOX News should walk away,"" Sullivan wrote, "" ... and citizens you care about the truth should demand that they do so."" Again, Margaret Sullivan didn't ask people to stop watching FOX News, she asked for us to be unemployed. Her colleague Max Boot agreed with that. Max Boot also labors for Jeff Bezos at ""The Washington Post."" Noticing a theme here? When you work for the world's richest man, people tend to listen to you. When you call for government officials to crush dissent, that's not a small thing. MAX BOOT, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: And there's also I think, the possibility of reviving the Fairness Doctrine, which the F.C.C. enforced until 1987 and which mandated some minimal standards of factuality and balance on the part of TV stations, and since that's disappeared, it's just been a complete free for all with all sorts of lunacy being fed directly into the right-wing ecosystem. CARLSON: Max Boot, ladies and gentlemen, the Fairness Doctrine. The Fairness Doctrine -- it is pretty amusing. Ignore the fact that the Fairness Doctrine does not even apply to cable news since the U.S. government doesn't own the cable lines. What you should consider is the idea that Max Boot just explained that it is quote, ""unfair"" for one news outlets to disagree with every other news outlet in the country. So diversity of opinion is unfair; sameness is fair that is why it should be mandatory. It's inclusive. Hilarious. In addition to everything else, you may have figured this out already, these people are stupid. Of course, they are stupid. That's why our country is in trouble because the people who run our country can't find their butts with both hands. Max Boot has no choice but to work at ""The Washington Post."" No self- respecting landscaping company would have Max Boot. But that doesn't mean Max Boot won't win. It's a mistake to imagine that simply because an idea is wrong, or stupid, or immoral that it cannot prevail, at least for a while, of course it can prevail. History is filled with examples of this. New Coke was a real beverage. The French Revolution actually happened. So we should be worried when large numbers of people start saying irrational things and they definitely are saying them. Joe Scarborough has a morning show over on MSNBC. Joe Scarborough isn't stupid, hardly. Look up animal cunning in the dictionary and you will find Joe Scarborough's picture. What Joe Scarborough is, is a herd animal. He's flexible. If all the kids are doing it, he wants a seat on the bus, he wants in. Watch Joe Scarborough explain the people who appear on FOX News need to be forced to shut up immediately. JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC HOST: FOX News had -- someone I know -- a former leader of the Republican Party saying that Democrats wanted -- and I'm using his words here -- Democrats wanted to, quote ""exterminate"" -- exterminate all Republicans. Let me say that again, for FOX News sponsors, you know, for FOX News sponsors to let you know what's happening now on FOX News. That they are getting people who are FOX News contributors who were saying that Democrats, Joe Biden and Democrats want to, quote, ""Exterminate all Republicans."" CARLSON: I'm saying this for FOX News sponsors. So how honest do you want to be here? The man you just saw has been accused in public by the President of the United States of murdering a young woman, not many cable news host can say that. Now, we're not taking a position on Joe Scarborough's guilt or innocence in that case, we're not a law enforcement agency. It's not our place to do that. But one thing we did not do and would never do is go on TV to demand that because Joe Scarborough was accused of violence by a politician, American companies should not be allowed to sell their products to his viewers. Doing that never even occurred to us, not for a second. We're not fascists, or for that matter, middle aged performers running away from their own consciences. We're Americans. We think people we disagree with should still be allowed to talk in public. The tech monopolies have never believed that, they're not American companies. They are global conglomerates that don't answer to voters. They are more powerful than our government at this point, you should know. Last week on CNN, the former chief security officer at Facebook -- how does that title strike you -- a man called Alex Stamos said all of this out loud. ALEX STAMOS, FORMER CHIEF SECURITY OFFICER AT FACEBOOK: It's really hard because what's happening is people are able to seek out the information that makes them feel good. That is what happening -- you know, people have so much choice now. They can choose what their news sources are. They can choose what influencers they want to follow. We have to turn down the capability of these conservative influencers to reach these huge audiences. There are people on YouTube, for example, that have a larger data -- larger audience than daytime CNN, and they are extremely radical and pushing extremely radical views. CARLSON: So in the name of democracy, clearly the term of the moment -- in the defense of the people's will, we must censor people and make certain that individuals can't read and hear what they choose to read and hear. At least they're being honest about it. Information is power. They want the power, therefore, they must control the information. And so they are, that's what's happening. We told you a moment ago that nobody seems to be fighting back against this tide of repression. But that's not entirely true. This weekend, Rupert Murdoch, the man who started this company won an award from a foundation in the U.K. and here's part of what he said when he accepted it, quote: ""For those of us in the media, there is a real challenge to confront a wave of censorship that seeks to silence conversation, to stifle debate, to ultimately stop individuals and societies from realizing their potential. This rigidly enforced conformity aided and abetted by so-called social media. It is a straightjacket on sensibility."" ""Too many people have fought too hard in too many places for freedom of speech to be suppressed by this awful woke orthodoxy."" This awful woke orthodoxy. Now we don't quote our boss on this show very often, ever actually. But that is exactly right. Awful woke Orthodoxy is precisely what this is. There's nothing worse for the country or for journalism by the way, every publisher, every owner of every media company should be saying this in public every single day. But they're not. Only ours is. No wonder they hate us. Glenn Greenwald is a journalist. You can find his work, which we hope you support on ""Substack."" He joins us now. Glenn, I want to ask you about this bill from Stephanie Murphy, which strikes me as particularly ominous in the context of the moment we are in that would ban people who fall within some category that she is defining, who have certain beliefs from effectively from serving in government. Should your personal beliefs be a criterion for employment in the Federal government? GLENN GREENWALD, JOURNALIST: Well, the through line for everything that just talked about, Tucker, is that the Democratic Party, which now controls the House, the Senate and the White House genuinely believes they have a monopoly on objective truth. They believe they're the party of science and rationality, and that the only way to disagree with them is if you're either a deranged conspiracy theorist or a seditionist, somebody who is engaged in criminal conduct or terrorism. And therefore, they genuinely believe, it's not a show. It's not a pretext. They all have convinced one another through this echo chamber that they've created, essentially, the entire media except this network, which is why they want to shut it down, that if you disagree with their orthodoxies and their consensus, you are a threat and a danger. And it's so ironic they spent four years claiming they are fighting fascism and authoritarianism, and what are they trying to do now? They're trying to harness corporate and monopoly power to silence everyone who disagrees with them, the very hallmark, the epitome of the fascism they claim to be fighting, but which in reality they embody. CARLSON: Well, it is kind of amusing. I'm trying to stay amused. I think it's important that they cite Russia as the thing that we hate most, because they crack down on press freedoms and it's not a true democracy as a pretext for imposing censorship on the press in the United States. I mean, is there no self-awareness at all? Or do they just don't care? GREENWALD: It's like they are -- it's like they are envious of Putin in that he's managed to consolidate the power that they wish they could wield and are trying to wield now. Tucker, they genuinely want everyone who disagrees with them silenced. I know it sounds like hyperbole if you don't pay attention constantly to the news. And it's not just random people who are saying it, it is leading members of the Democratic Party, they're going to have partners in like the Liz Cheney wing of the Republican Party as well. CARLSON: That's right. GREENWALD: They want to exploit their power to regulate corporations and monopolies to -- they're saying it outright. They're saying, we now control and regulate your industry and we demand that you stop using your advertising money for this network that criticizes us, the party in control. Now, if that isn't authoritarianism, what is? They want to shut everybody off the internet. They destroyed an entire social media platform. They just took it off of the internet, because they instructed Silicon Valley monopolies that it was their obligation to remove it. It is very chilling. You really can't overstate how bloodthirsty they are and the control that they're trying to exert over our discourse. CARLSON: I told you before, but there were times years ago, I thought maybe Glenn's a little bit paranoid. I don't -- I don't think that at all anymore. I think you're prophetic and I appreciate your coming on. Thank you. Good to see you. GREENWALD: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: So the people with the most power in the world aren't simply trying to destroy FOX News, though they are. We're not making that up. They're open about it. They would also like to unravel the social fabric of this country, things like gender and men and women. Those are the foundations of any civilization and all of a sudden, they have no meaning. Abigail Shrier has thought a lot in the face of an awful lot of hostility and opposition about what this means for the rest of us. She joins us next. CARLSON: As we told you the other night, Joe Biden has just signed an Executive Order, it is one of his first acts as President that essentially invalidates the idea of biological sex. It has many implications, long term implications, but one of them is that will allow biological men to compete in women's sports. To understand what effect this will have in practical terms, consider this one fact. Three hundred male high school students in this country have faster 400 meter times than the fastest female sprinter in the world. So it's not a small thing for all of us, but particularly for women's sports. Abigail Shrier is one of the very few people who thought this through, brought her conclusions public and faced the enormous hostility and threats that have resulted. She's the author of the book ""Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters."" We're happy to have her on tonight. Abigail Shrier, thanks so much for coming on. Again, you're one of the very few people in our public conversation who is willing to say what you do and present your conclusions without apology. What do you think of this executive order? ABIGAIL SHRIER, AUTHOR, ""IRREVERSIBLE DAMAGE"": I mean, this order spells the destruction of women's sports. It's probably the greatest blow to women's rights we've seen in decades. You know, Allyson Felix is the Olympian you mentioned who is a remarkable, possibly the greatest female sprinter of all time. She has more Olympic medals than Usain Bolt. And as you said, you know, her time for the 400 meter is 49.26 seconds. Okay? Nearly 300 high school boys in 2018 in America alone could beat it. So what we're talking about is a world in which no one's ever heard of Allyson Felix, a world in which Allyson Felix doesn't even make the team. CARLSON: I just wonder why. I mean, you make this -- and I think there are a lot of implications, this would affect all of us, regardless of sex, but it certainly would seem a direct attack on the women's rights you just explained, Title 9, for example. I don't see any women's groups standing up in the face of this to point that out. Why? SHRIER: Well, you know, there is sort of the hard left, and it has its deconstructionist reasons and then there are the useful idiots who are going along with it. And I think a lot of people, you know, believe in -- you know, they tend to hide behind language of inclusivity. This is more inclusive. The truth is, if you want it to be inclusive, what you would do, of course, would be to make sure that transgender athletes who have male bodies feel welcome and comfortable on the male teams because putting male bodies against male bodies, that's what sports is about. It's about bodies. It's not about identification. CARLSON: Right. So, but by doing that, you would be conceding that sex differences are biological and unchanging, and the cosmetic surgery doesn't make them go away and you can't concede that because you have to play along with the why or else they hurt you. SHRIER: Well, you know, this is the stuff that's -- this is actual science, right? It's actually, right -- also common sense. I mean, look, you can lower someone's activation, all levels of testosterone, okay? But it won't make an important difference. And the reason is -- or it won't make enough of a difference and the reason is that male puberty confers a massive and unbridgeable and permanent advantage on male bodies. We know that. They have faster -- they have larger hearts, larger lungs, more fast twitch muscle fiber, vastly greater muscle mass and bone density, all things necessary in contests of strength and speed. CARLSON: So I mean, what our high school biology class is going to look like? Is every biology teacher going to have to go along with the lie? SHRIER: I hope not. You know, at some point, I would really encourage Americans for when this comes to your school, it's time to stand up. It's time to stand up for our girls. CARLSON: Amen. You're a brave person and I hope that your example inspires people. I really do. Abigail Shrier, thank you very much. SHRIER: Thank you. Thank you. CARLSON: We told you last week about an internal e-mail sent from a senior I.C.E. official in Texas. That e-mail ordered the quote, ""release of all illegal immigrants in Federal custody."" There have been some major developments tonight on that order and we'll tell you what they are. We will be joined by former White House adviser Stephen Miller. We'll be right back. CARLSON: As we reported to you last week on Friday, immigration officials were told in an internal e-mail on Thursday to release all migrants from detention quote, ""immediately."" We have more detail tonight on this e-mail and on the internal response to it as the Justice Department released the e-mail and related correspondence in court today. Now that filing shows that the orders in this e-mail were retracted after this show reached out to D.H.S. on Friday afternoon for comment, quote, this was their response internally, ""Retract this directive immediately. Please direct your supervisors to follow the memorandum issued. Operational guidance is being developed and will be issued in the coming days,"" end quote. Now that retraction came a day and a half after the initial e-mail once again, right after we called about it. Another I.C.E. official chimed in and said that the order to release migrants only applied to some detainees who were set to be deported, but now wouldn't be removed due to the new presidential order. This group of detainees is considered a quote ""high risk"" of getting ill from COVID. Detainees qualify if they're over the age of 55, have high blood pressure or have diabetes, all of them can thank this order for the special treatment they are getting. The roll out of this deportation moratorium clearly, at very least, has been chaotic, but it also has implications for the rule of law, for the nature of this country going forward. Stephen Miller has thought a lot about this. He is a former White House Senior adviser. He joins us tonight. Stephen Miller, thanks so much for coming on. STEPHEN MILLER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE SENIOR ADVISER: Thank you for having me, Tucker. CARLSON: So explain since you just spent four years in the face of very intense opposition both outside the White House and within it, working on this issue. What does this mean? Tell us that the implications of Joe Biden's presidential directive on immigration? MILLER: Thank you, Tucker. This is the most extreme direction I would argue, really in the history of modern law enforcement that's ever been issued. Let me break it down for everybody. Acting Secretary Pekoske issued a memorandum on the evening of January 20th, the day of the Inauguration, putting into place a 100-day deportation moratorium. There's very narrow exceptions in that memorandum that would apply to only a handful of people in a given year. It would be, you know, terrorists and spies and really extraordinary cases. But the 180,000 people that I.C.E. removed last year, those same 180,000 people could not be removed this year as a result of that deportation moratorium. Now, of those 180,000 people, Tucker, 92 percent of them are criminals, either charged or convicted of a crime. In this memo, there is no exceptions clause for criminals. I repeat, there is no exceptions clause for criminals. What does this mean, operationally? And why was that e-mail sent? What it means Tucker, is that the work of I.C.E. officers will grind to a halt beginning February 1st. Why February 1st? Because that's the date by which I.C.E. has to come up with implementing guidance for the memo. And so every Sheriff's Office, every Police Department, every Correctional Facility in the country that for years has been handing over illegal aliens to I.C.E. to pick them up and take them home, which is the bread and butter of I.C.E.'s work, all of those people will not get picked up anymore. Why won't they get picked up? Because you cannot arrest someone you can't deport. That's a foundational principle of immigration law. I.C.E. is not a jail. I.C.E. has detention facilities exclusively for staging people for removal. You cannot pick up somebody that you're not going to remove. So beginning in just a few days, about 12,000 criminals a month are going to be released into U.S. communities. I'm basing that 12,000 number on what the average was last year of how many arrests were given in a particular month or how many arrests were made of a particular month. It could actually be higher than that because last year, obviously, the pandemic numbers went down a bit with the vaccine, arrest normally, you would expect them to go back up. So I'd say between 12,000 to 15,000 criminals a month, Tucker, are going to be loose back into U.S. communities. But it gets even worse. In addition to that, they are forbidden by the terms of this memo for removing visa overstays. Any student who comes here, any foreign worker who comes here on a temporary visa that expiration date now means nothing. Worksite enforcement, Tucker, gone. It doesn't exist anymore. As of January 20th, Joe Biden has declared there is no more workplace immigration law. You as a U.S. citizen do not have the protection of your laws. Your civil rights do not matter. What about immigration courts, Tucker? What if you fail to appear in immigration court? Can you be deported under this memo? No. What if you show up in immigration court, you're already removed, but decide not to go home? Can someone come pick you up and take you home? No. The whole system, Tucker, is dismantled. CARLSON: This is -- I don't think we fully understood the implications of this when we reported on this order last week, and they are far more terrifying than I even thought and I'm grateful to you for explaining that, but really bothered by that. I hope you'll come back. Stephen Miller, thank you. MILLER: Thank you so much, Tucker. CARLSON: It turns out Joe Biden isn't simply a new President. He's a holy man. He's a miracle worker. From California to Illinois to the State of Michigan, suddenly coronavirus restrictions as if by magic have been lifted. What's changed exactly apart from his healing touch? We'll tell you after the break. CARLSON: Joe Biden is now the President and you know what that means. It means it's time for science. You know what science is. That's when you get people in lab coats to nod vigorously as you lay out your political decrees. In practical terms, it means the coronavirus has changed once again. California, Illinois and Washington, D.C. have all announced that indoor dining isn't dangerous anymore. That was fast. He's a healer, that Joe Biden. In the State of Michigan, officials said they'll lift the indoor dining ban on February 1st even though daily coronavirus deaths in that state are still higher than they were when the indoor dining ban was announced. So it didn't work. But we're now going to nods, and we are doing it anyway, because Joe Biden is the President. How did he do that? How does he get so holy? Chadwick Moore is a columnist with ""Spectator U.S.A."" He's not a theologian, but he joins us tonight to assess Joe Biden's healing powers. What do you make of this, Chadwick Moore? It is great to see you, by the way. CHADWICK MOORE, COLUMNIST, ""SPECTATOR U.S.A."": Well, it's not unheard of. You know, I heard that when Kim Il-sung the founder of North Korea was born, a new star appeared in the sky and a double rainbow. So you know, some leaders just had that touch here when Joe Biden was coronated, not only did this broken and fractured land that a dictator had destroyed suddenly become healed and united, but the virus is gone, amazingly. You know, I know that some of these Democratic leaders in places like New York and California only had about six or seven months to see that they could reopen their states like Florida and Texas or Georgia, and have everything be basically fine. But it's amazing that just suddenly, after the Inauguration, suddenly after all the final pieces were laid and the Electoral College vote was confirmed, you had Andrew Cuomo first leading the charge. And then of course, we all knew that California, Illinois and these other states would follow suit. It's just interesting that these Democrat voters don't see that, you know, there is this speculation that these governors held their states hostage, a vise grip, psychologically and economically, is mainly just too dark for some people to fathom. But that certainly seems to be what happened here. All for political optics, all to keep the economic numbers down to hurt Trump before the election and just to wait until Joe Biden came into office. CARLSON: So if what happened on January 6th is now being described as an armed racist insurrection, the question is how long until we hear that the lockdowns were imposed on this nation by right-wing racist evangelical QAnon extremists? MOORE: Well, they might try to spin or they probably just won't acknowledge it. It's not like they have anything to worry about with the media calling them out on this behavior. CARLSON: Good point. MOORE: Obviously, they're protected. I mean, Andrew Cuomo got an Emmy for his press conferences, before he wrote a book congratulating himself on handling the virus before it was even over. Of course, New York, for example, their virus rates are higher today than they were a month ago. But in a lot of these places, the rates are higher. And yet, still now it's fine to open. It seems like they were holding people hostage. I don't think they'll want to even acknowledge that this is what it looks like. You know, the lesson here seems to be that things are much nicer when the Democrats control everything, so you better keep us in power because we can take it away again. CARLSON: Of course. They've done a great job of Chicago. Chadwick Moore, great to see you tonight. Thank you so much. MOORE: Thank you. CARLSON: If you're noticing a theme here, it's that in modern America, all of us are forced to lie about the obvious all the time. The one thing you can't say are the things that are right in front of your face. The more obvious it is, the more forbidden it is to note. What does it do to a society after a while? Well, if you thought coronavirus vaccine meant your kids could go back to school, oh, no. Teachers unions aren't for that. We will tell you what they're saying straight ahead. CARLSON: Teachers unions all over the country are still refusing to go back to work, vaccine or not. In Chicago, the teachers union is defying the government's reopening ban, the third largest school district in the country. Kids have killed themselves because of the displacement of these lockdowns. Joe Biden said today he supports the teachers union's decision. Dr. Marc Siegel is a FOX News medical contributor. He joins us tonight to assess this decision. Doctor, good to see you. DR. MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR: Tucker, let's start with the fact -- good evening, let's start with the fact that the Chicago teachers union is the boy who cried wolf. They struck in 2012 for seven days. In 2019, they struck for 15 days and inconvenienced drastically 300,000 kids in the school district. So it's hard to believe them now with their posturing. They're claiming, well, there may not be enough precautions in place. But Chicago Public Schools reports spending $100 million on their schools to make them safe for ventilation, for distancing, for masking, for proper testing. The district down the road, Lagrange is already doing saliva testing on all of their students. There's no reason whatsoever, these schools can't be open, especially given what you said, you know, the collateral damage here. Over in Clark County where Las Vegas is, there's been 3,100 calls to suicide hotlines from kids, Tucker, over the course of their schools being closed and 18 children have committed suicide over the nine months of the pandemic, 18 children and that's the same thing that can happen in Chicago. But let me point out something which is that COVID-19 does not spread easily among children. It does not spread easily from children to teachers and we know that. What does spread easily is despair, is anxiety, is depression, is not getting your teeth taken care of, or your eyes examined or not having you looked at for developmental delays -- all the things you need in school. So I will say this to Chicago teachers union tonight, Tucker, the vaccine is coming. Next week, you guys qualify, all the teachers can get the vaccine. Hey, Tucker, I bet when the Chicago teachers union gets the vaccine, they're going to reopen everything right, Tucker? CARLSON: Responsible adults would rather get COVID than hurt kids. Period. It's just that simple and I wish they understood. Dr. Siegel, great to see you. Thank you. SIEGEL: Absolutely. Thank you, Tucker. CARLSON: We are out of time, sadly. We'll be back tomorrow night, 8:00 p.m., the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. Sean Hannity is standing by in New York. Take it away, Sean. Classification"
2021-02-04,"TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening, and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. What a weekend. It's only Thursday, but there's been really only one story in Washington, D.C. and across the country. There has been an enormous amount of talk, not just this week, but over the last month about violent extremism, and the people who embrace it, the dangerous people. Those people are domestic terrorists we are told, they must be put down by force. The war on terror has moved stateside. Extremists have breached our walls. They are inside our country. And in response, we must hunt them down. Doing that is existential, our country depends on it. Our lives depend on it. Now, we're hearing those words nonstop on cable news, but not just on cable news, we are hearing the very same thing from elected officials, including some Republican elected officials. We're hearing it from the leaders of Federal law enforcement agencies and of the Intelligence Agencies. We're hearing it from The Pentagon. Just this week, the new Secretary of Defense ordered the entire U.S. military to quote, ""stand down"" while investigators cleanse the ranks of political extremists. And of course, we're hearing it from the business establishment, from Wall Street and the tech monopolies from the massive multinational corporations that increasingly control the contours of American life. All of them are now on the hunt for political extremists. And at one level, that does not sound bad, because no sane person is for political extremism, especially violent extremism. We're against it. We're for moderation. We're for incremental change. We're for the consent of the governed. We said that every day for four years and we meant it. We don't like extremists either. We attack them regularly. But it's not enough to be against something. You have to be more precise than that. What is it that you're against? In order to root out a problem, you have to know what it is. You need a sense of what you're looking for. You need a clear sight picture. You have to define the terms. And here's the remarkable thing about this public conversation we're having. No one is doing that. Have you noticed? None of these newly energized and highly empowered extremist hunters have told us exactly what an extremist is. So, we're left to guess, we're left to look around nervously to see if we can spot one, hoping against hope the whole time they are not talking about us, are they? And if they are, what exactly are they doing? How are they hunting these extremists they keep telling us about, but will not describe? We now know part of the answer to that question. This show has obtained exclusively evidence that Bank of America, the second largest bank in the country with more than 60 million customers is actively but secretly engaged in the hunt for extremists in cooperation with the government. Bank of America is without the knowledge or the consent of its customers, sharing private information with Federal law enforcement agencies. Bank of America effectively is acting as an Intelligence Agency. But they are not telling you about it. In the days after the January 6th riot at the Capitol, Bank of America went through its own customers financial and transaction records, a lot of them. Now, these were the private records of Americans who had committed no crime, people who as far as we know, had absolutely nothing to do with what happened at the Capitol on January 6th. But at the request of Federal investigators, Bank of America searched its databases looking for people who fit a specific profile. Here's what that profile was, and we are quoting: ""Customers confirmed as transacting either through bank account debit card or credit card purchases in Washington, D.C. between January 5th and January 6th."" Number two: ""Purchases made for hotels, Airbnb, RSVPs in Washington, Virginia or Maryland after January 6th."" Number three: ""Any purchase of weapons or at a weapon related merchant between January 7th and their upcoming suspected stay in the D.C. area around Inauguration Day."" And four: ""Airline related purchases since January 6th,"" end quote. So what do you notice about that profile? Well, the first thing you notice is that it's remarkably broad. Any purchases of anything in the City of Washington, D.C., any overnight stay anywhere in the three-state area that spans hundreds of miles. Any purchase not simply of legal firearms, but instead anything bought from a quote ""weapons related merchant,"" t-shirts included, and then any airline related purchases. Not just flights to Washington, flights to anywhere -- to Omaha, to Thailand. That is a very, very wide net, an absurdly wide net. Bank of America identified a total of 211 customers who met these quote ""thresholds of interest."" And it was at that point, the show has learned, Bank of America turned over the results of its internal scan to Federal authorities, apparently without notifying the customers who were being spied upon. Federal investigators then interviewed at least one of these unsuspecting people and that person we've learned hadn't done anything wrong and in the end was cleared. Imagine if you were that person. The F.B.I. hauls you in for questioning in a terror investigation, not because you've done anything suspicious, you haven't. You bought plane tickets and visited your country's capital. You thought you could do that, you thought it was your country. Now, they're sweating you because your bank, which you trust with your most private information, information of everything you buy, has ratted you out to the Feds without telling you, without your knowledge. Because Bank of America did that, you are being treated like a member of al-Qaeda. What country is this? It doesn't matter how much you despise Donald Trump or how much you believe that hatred of Trump justifies suspending this country's ancient civil liberties. Going through that experience would scare the hell out of you. Absolutely. A terror suspect, you would think? Does anyone else know about this? Is there a record of this interview while I lose my job because of it? That actually happened to someone. It's hard to believe it, but it did. We asked Bank of America about this. They confirmed it actually happened by not denying it. Here's their statement in full which manages to make the whole thing even creepier assuming that's possible. Quote, ""We don't comment on our communications with law enforcement."" Well, apparently not. ""All banks,"" it continues, ""... have responsibilities under Federal law to cooperate with law enforcement inquiries in full compliance with the law,"" end quote. Now the last part, from a lawyer's perspective, is the essence in full compliance with the law. It's the law, we had no choice. But that's not true. Bank of America did have a choice. The bank could have resisted turning over information on its innocent customers to Federal investigators, but Bank of America did not do that. Nor is it clear if we're going to be precise about it, that what Bank of America did is even legal. It turns out, it's not simple. It's a gray area. We spoke to a number of lawyers about this today. Some of them told us that what Bank of America did might in fact not be legal and could in fact be challenged in court. One knowledgeable attorney pointed us to 12 USC 34.03. That's a Federal law that allows banks to tip off the Feds to any information that quote, ""May be relevant to a possible violation of any statute or regulation."" Now the D.O.J. instructs Federal agents to remind banks of that law and of course they do with maximum aggression. But the question is, legally, what constitutes information that may be relevant to a possible crime? Buying a muffin in Washington, D.C. on January 5th? Does it make you a potential domestic extremist? According to Bank of America, yes. Yes, it does. This is the moment when for the sake of our country and our grandchildren who will live here, we need to pause and breathe deeply searching for wisdom, avoiding hysteria and ask what are the rules. What for God's sakes is a political extremist? A lot hangs on that question. Maybe everything. Please tell us. But they won't tell us. Poignantly, they won't tell us. Today at the White House, for example, the new National Security Adviser, Jake Sullivan, told reporters that, quote, ""Domestic extremism is the urgent crisis of our time. Rooting out domestic political extremism is more important than anything else,"" more important than getting a job, running your business, and attending to your family. But Sullivan did not again, tellingly, explain what it is. JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: So build back better isn't just about economics, it is about national security as well. And then it's about the set of issues that working families in this country are facing every day that are challenging their lives and livelihoods, the pandemic, climate change, the threat of domestic violent extremism. CARLSON: Domestic violent extremism. There it is. The worst thing. But no sense of what that means. We're starting to believe they're not defining it for a reason. What's the other explanation? Yesterday, an op-ed in ""The New York Times"" asked this question: ""Are private messaging apps the next misinformation hotspot?"" Private messaging apps? Signal? A bunch of others, they're encrypted, no one can read it. ""The New York Times"" doesn't like this. Why? Because if they can't see what you're saying, maybe you shouldn't be allowed to say it. As the newspaper put it, quote, ""The shift to private messaging has renewed a debate over whether encryption is a double-edged sword. While the technology prevents people from being spied upon, it might also make it easier for criminals and misinformation spreaders to do harm without getting caught."" Notice that criminals and misinformation spreaders are in the same sentence. They're pretty much the same thing. What's a misinformation spreader? Well, it is someone who doesn't agree with ""The New York Times"" -- obviously, a violent extremist, and they're dangerous. If you think we're joking, we're not. They are pulling this thread every day. According to Democratic Party, we need to start screening the social media accounts of people who work for the government just to make sure. REP. JACKIE SPEIER (D-CA): So it's time for us to open our eyes and recognize what's going on. The fact that we do not look at social media of potential recruits into the military flabbergast me. CARLSON: Saagar Enjeti hosts a very popular show for ""The Hill"" newspaper. He joins us now to define this essential phrase of the moment. Everything hangs on this, Saagar. We're happy you're here. And so I'm hoping to get a clear explanation, a clear definition of what this phrase means: what is a political extremist? A domestic extremist? SAAGAR ENJETI, OPINION HOST, ""THE HILL"": A domestic political extremist, by these people's definitions is everyone who does not agree with the professional managerial class and the people who run this country. And what we're seeing right now, Tucker, is one of the most dangerous episodes in modern American history. It is the fusion of the people who run our culture, our largest institutions with the post 9/11 security state. And we need to remember that the people who run the post 9/11 security state are the greatest failures of the modern era. You talked about The Pentagon and General Lloyd Austin or Secretary now of Defense, Lloyd Austin, this is the person who failed to quote-unquote, ""arm"" all of these, you know, moderate rebels in Syria. He wasted hundreds of millions of dollars. Right where I stand right here where I'm sitting, there is fencing around the Capitol. We learned today that it costs half a billion dollars for the National Guard deployment. So we see the excesses of the money. We see the deployment of the entire surveillance state, things like with Bank of America, the proposal of new laws. John Brennan has already come out and said that people within the C.I.A. and others are beginning to hunt these quote-unquote, ""domestic extremists"" here on American soil. Now, don't let it be said, the C.I.A. is not even supposed to operate on American soil. So what is he saying there? This is truly one of the most dangerous episodes. And in this case, the post 9/11 security state is not even being monitored by the media or people in the culture because they agree with the people who are being -- they agree with the people who are hunting the hunted. CARLSON: After 9/11, we had at least a working definition that we talked a lot about in public of what a terrorist was. And of course, in the end, a terrorist committed acts of terror, which were acts of violence designed to kill innocence in order to make a political point. That's not -- for all the awful things we saw on January 6th, that's not one of them actually, that didn't happen. Other bad things happened. That's not one of them. It wasn't terrorism. It was a riot. So I wonder that's the pretext upon which they are justifying 9/11 level surveillance suspension of civil liberties, effectively Martial Law in the capital? It is that? ENJETI: Exactly, Tucker. I mean, did we need thousands of American troops? Or did we maybe just need a hundred more cops on that day on January 6th and the entire thing looks different? Do we need a half a billion dollar deployment? Do we need a new domestic terror law? Every law on the books is probably already too many on the books. But all of those could have been stopped, what happened on January 6th, the same thing that occurred on 9/11, and many of these different cases. It's all just an excuse for the people in the security state, one, to keep making money; two, in order to expand their vast powers. And I am deeply troubled by the people who ruined Iraq and Afghanistan now trying to bring their methods to the United States. I saw Joy Reid on MSNBC talking about de-Ba'athification. Do you or I want to break the news to her about how that worked out in Iraq? These people have no business trying to de-Ba'athify or de-extremify anyone anywhere. CARLSON: Well, they're creating extremists, just as we did in Iraq. They are creating -- they are making it a dead certainty that somebody is going to be driven in total lunacy and do something terrible. I mean, they are making people crazy and dramatically elevating the chances something really awful is going to happen and I'm upset about it. I think we all should be. Saagar, I appreciate your coming on tonight and your clarity as always. ENJETI: Thank you, Tucker. CARLSON: So, it looks like the Dwarf King is indeed emerging permanently from his lair at CNN and stepping down. The calls to shut down this network and speech in general, unapproved thoughts continue to flow from CNN. We'll tell you why after the break. CARLSON: Well, the first time we told you about the recall effort in California, the one to remove Gavin Newsom as Governor, it seemed like just a remote possibility. Now, it has a very real chance of succeeding Interesting. Meanwhile, under Los Angeles's new progressive DA, George Gascon, more hardened criminals have a chance to get out of prison than ever before. That would include serial rapists. Bill Melugin is a reporter with FOX LA. He's got that story for us tonight. Hey, Bill. BILL MELUGIN, REPORTER, FOX LOS ANGELES: Hey, Tucker, good evening to you. So literally, as soon as DA George Gascon took office here in LA, he issued a series of directives that he says are meant to stop a system of mass incarceration here in Los Angeles. He got rid of cash bail. He is no longer prosecuting juveniles as adults. He got rid of Gun and Gang Enhancements. He got rid of special circumstance allegations. He is no longer prosecuting California's three strikes law, and he is no longer allowing his own prosecutors to attend parole hearings for criminals when they have a parole hearing and that is causing issues for victims' families here in LA. If we can pull up the mug shot, this is a story I did last night. This is Howard Jones, a double murderer who shot and killed two teenagers back in 1988. He has been in prison since 1991. He was denied parole two times in 2015 and 2017. But yesterday he had a third parole hearing, and because prosecutors weren't allowed to attend it under Gascon's reforms, he was granted parole yesterday. It's going to be up to Governor Gavin Newsom, but the victims' family are furious. They say they were abandoned. They had to face the killer alone with no support and they say, it is disgusting that he is going to potentially get out after only 30 years in prison for killing two people. If we can pull up another story. This is what I did Monday night. This was the subterranean rapist. This was a guy who terrorized LA back in 1981. He raped or sexually assaulted approximately 50 women. He has got a parole hearing coming up, and just like the last story, he is not going to have prosecutors there because of Gascon's reforms. No one is be there to argue that he stay locked up; and his victims who I interviewed, they are terrified. They say they're going to have to face that guy, the guy who raped them, and they're not going to have any support there. And then last month, if we can pull up another mug shot, this is probably the most heinous one yet. This is a man who raped two young children when they were ages six and eight. This was in the early 2000s. He raped them repeatedly, sodomized them. He has been in prison since the early 2000s. He also has a parole hearing coming up and you can guess where this is going. Prosecutors will not be at that hearing. The victims are horrified. They're going to have to face him alone, terrified that he could potentially get out. A recall of George Gascon, an effort for it has already started. He has only been in office for two months -- Tucker. CARLSON: Really shocking stories. Bill, I appreciate your bringing those to national attention. This stuff has gotten lost. You've been on it, terrier- like and I appreciate it, it's important. Thank you. So at the end of last night's show, right at the end, we told you that the Dwarf King might be vacating his musky lair over at CNN. It turns out we were right. This morning, Jeff Zucker informed his bewildered minions at the disgraced cable that in fact, he is leaving at the end of this year and honestly, we're going to miss him. In a business filled with blustery halfwits, Zucker was absolutely the blusteriest, if that's a word. ""You cannot be elected President of the United States without CNN,"" he once boasted to his felon lawyer buddy, Michael Cohen, a tape we brought you a few months ago. Hilarious. It's kind of hard to beat that level of entertainment with your pants on. We didn't even have to watch CNN to enjoy it. But it's also worth remembering Jeff Zucker's other contribution to the American media landscape. Jeff Zucker's relentless attacks on the freedom of speech. Zucker created an entire unit at CNN devoted to shutting down any news organization that refused to toe the ruling class line. If you had unauthorized questions about anything, Jeff Zucker wanted to force you to be quiet and he tried. Zucker's staffed his own little Ministry of Truth with two of the most repulsive yet obedient imposters he could find. Political activist posing as reporters; thugs, pretending to be objective analysts. He set them loose to silence free thinking journalists with threats, lies and bullying. In a number of cases, they have been successful, a tragedy every time. CNN is in fact trying its best to pull this show and FOX itself off the air for good. Harm reduction, that's what they call it, as if FOX News was a deadly pathogen. That is not the behavior of a legitimate news organization, but it is exactly what CNN has become, a TV that makes a billion dollars a year using the First Amendment to kill free speech in the rest of the media. That's wrong, but it's not just wrong. It's frightening. You don't want to live in the country CNN is creating. But Jeff Zucker has not done this alone. Going forward, we want to be a lot more specific and much more detailed about who is trying to strip you of your most valuable birthright as an American, which is the freedom to speak and hear the truth. Everything is based on that. And you should know the names of the people trying to take it away. You should know why they're trying to do it. You should understand the stakes. We want to begin tonight briefly because we're going to have a lot more time in the coming weeks and months because it's important, but we want to begin tonight with Jeff Zucker's boss, a man called John Stankey. Now John Stankey runs AT&T, which owns CNN. Stankey knows what Jeff Zucker does at CNN and he strongly approves of it. Last year, Stankey announced that Zucker was doing quote, ""a wonderful job"" at the, and you should be concerned about that. AT&T is an enormously powerful company. In 2019, its net income was nearly $14 billion. More ominous, AT&T controls over a million miles of fiber lines. Chances are, virtually everything you know about the outside world flows through AT&T's property. So John Stankey's opinions matter, he has an awful lot of control over your life. John Stankey thinks it is okay to silence the show, to silence you. Why does John Stankey think that? We would very much love to ask him. But in the meantime, we will keep digging and we're going to let you know what we find. Speaking of deadly pathogens, Critical Race Theory is spreading. A new website, we will tell you, if it's in your kid's school, that's next. CARLSON: We spend an awful lot of time beating up on journalists and the sorry state of journalism, but we don't want it to be all negative. Of course, we'll hold up the miscreants for abuse. But we also want to celebrate the good guys once in a while and tonight, we want to bring you the story of a genuine investigative journalist, a man who has been forgotten, cast aside like an Acosta, when he really should be an Edward R. Murrow, and that's an injustice we plan to rectify right now. When everyone else was saying you should wear a mask to protect yourself from the coronavirus, this man told you, you should wear three masks. Not just one, three. Behavior like that isn't taught, you're born with it. You've got it or you don't. Well, last night this same investigative journalist now an anchor at CNBC broke the story of a lifetime. If Pulitzer Prizes still mattered, and they don't, this will get a Pulitzer. You've seen ""The Zapruder"" film, you've seen the moon landing. You've never seen anything like this. Roll tape. SHEPARD SMITH, CNBC NEWS ANCHOR: We all fantasize about a time when we won't have to wear the masks anymore, it is not now, but some at a supermarket in Florida appear to have decided that the time is now. Look at this. This was the scene at Oaks Farms Seed to Table Market in Naples today. NBC's Sam Brock took this video which went viral. It looks like it was taken pre-pandemic, right? Most customers and employees not wearing masks at all. CARLSON: This was the scene, a woman smiled in a grocery store. Actually, it wasn't quite what we thought it was. He believed the hype, I guess. Maybe when you've spent 30 years reading scripts about car chases, everything seems like a car chase. The problem is not everything is a car chase, sometimes it's just people smiling at each other in a grocery store. Sorry, overheated news guy, that's not actually news. Well, many colleges and universities now teach something called Critical Race Theory. Now, according to Critical Race Theory, some races are inherently better than other races. This isn't an assault on racism, it is racism and it is spreading, bewilderingly. The deepest possible betrayal of the promise of this country, of every Martin Luther King speech ever given, and yet it's in your kid's school. One Law Professor started a website called criticalrace.org. Once again, that's criticalrace.org. You can use that site to track the spread of these diseased ideas in schools, and seeing if they've infected the schools that your children go to. Bill Jacobson is a Professor at Cornell Law School. He started this. He joins us tonight. Professor, thanks so much for coming on. You're a brave man even to criticize this highly fashionable, deeply poisonous idea, but you're actually tracking it. Why are you doing this? What have you found? BILL JACOBSON, PROFESSOR, CORNELL LAW SCHOOL: Sure. Hi, Tucker. Well, the reason I started to follow it was at Cornell University where I teach in Law School, they implemented a push over the summer to embed what they call anti-racism ideology into every aspect of the campus. And as you know, and you've explained on your show, anti-racism does not actually mean what people think it means. It actually is very racist. Current discrimination in order to remedy past discrimination is the ideology. So I saw this developing. I started to research it. I was going to write an op-ed or an article about it, and then I realized it was almost everywhere. And so we began to gather the data. We're focused now on higher education because that's the source of all, that's where the ideology developed, and that's where people are trained and we've created criticalrace.org which is a database with an interactive map, where people can find out what the colleges and universities to which they may be sending their children or their children may be going have going on. And it really is a full-fledged database. You can hover over the map. You can click on your state. You can click on your school. We have 220 universities in the database now and we're expecting to expand it to 500, and you can find out what's going on. Everything is sourced, everything is linked, and the database is actually neutral. It's just data. You can find out what's going on at schools. Maybe you like it. Maybe you want your children to be sent to a school where they get indoctrinated or maybe you're going to send them to a school where you don't know what's going on and this is a way to find out. CARLSON: It's amazing. And what a public service, by the way. I don't think anyone in good faith could argue against more knowledge, which is what you're providing. What's the reaction been to this? JACOBSON: The reaction so far has been overwhelmingly favorable. We just rolled it out this week. We have a tip line, a contact form, a lot of people have been submitting information about the universities and colleges. And again, we only use publicly sourced information. This is what the colleges tell themselves. They love to talk about this stuff. They love to pat themselves on the back about this, but it probably doesn't make it to their admissions brochures and you can find this out at our website and it's been overwhelmingly favorable. And I'll tell you, the one big reaction we've gotten is when are you going to do this for K through 12? Because K through 12, is where a lot of the problems are happening now. I'm not sure when we're going to be able to roll out something like that. But a lot of parents -- we are entering admission season, you're going to be looking at schools. Don't just worry about what athletic facilities they have, what the dining room serves, worry about whether your children are going to have to take mandatory courses and mandatory training in an ideology, which as you've indicated, is the complete opposite of everything we've been taught to believe as good and just, which is to view people based on their inherent worth and their worthiness, and not to pay attention to the skin tone color of them. But that's what's being taught on campuses. It is that the overwhelmingly most important thing in society is the color of your skin and everything derives from that, and you need to know and we're trying to empower parents and students. CARLSON: Well, bless you for doing that. Some races are better than others. You know, I thought we kind of settled the question about whether that was poison or not. It is poison. It'll destroy your kids. It'll wreck the country. So thank you for fighting back. I appreciate it. Great. JACOBSON: Thank you. CARLSON: Well, the world's most interesting Congresswoman Sandy Cortez in Westchester County, New York defied the odds when she survived that deadly white supremacist insurrection at the Capitol last month. But that's not the only thing she did. That's not the only act of bravery in her long and storied life. She has cheated death many times. We'll tell you how. Stay tuned. CARLSON: America has been riveted this week by the tale of a young congresswoman's harrowing brush with death at the hands of insurrectionists. In case you've been in Malawi or locked away in Federal prison, and somehow missed it, here's the scariest part. REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): I jumped into my bathroom and I close the door and I just keep hearing, bang, bang, bang. I opened the door when all of a sudden I hear that whoever was trying to get inside got into my office. And I just hear ""Where is she? Where is she?"" And this was the moment where I thought everything was over. CARLSON: Everything was over. As we said, harrowing -- it actually can't really take credit for that description because that's exactly what the rest of the media said, too, harrowing. It's like that one three-syllable word occurred to all of us at precisely the same moment. Weird. Watch. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has given a harrowing account of her experience on January 6th. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A harrowing and emotional account of what happened to her during the Capitol riot. KASIE HUNT, NBC NEWS, CAPITOL HILL CORRESPONDENT: It's one of the most harrowing accounts so far. JOY REID, MSNBC HOST: Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tell that harrowing story. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The harrowing story of how she hid from attackers during the Capitol riot. CORTEZ: Boom, boom, boom. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Disclosing new harrowing details. CARLSON: They've never met anyone so brave. What they don't know is that surviving the white nationalist coup d'etat on January 6th was merely Sandy Cortez's latest feat of death defying bravery. For the world's most interesting Congresswoman, fleeing for her life from a mob of bloodthirsty terrorists in horned Viking hats in downtown Washington, just another day at the office. She has been doing that kind of thing for years. It's what she does. Back a long time ago when America faced off against the last outbreak of global Trumpist fascism, AOC didn't pause. She put her climate activism at BU on hold and she rose to the call. Sandy joined the famed Tuskegee Air Persons. She flew over 16,000 missions against the enemy. For her work saving democracy, Sandy won the coveted Victoria Cross for gallantry. It accented her uniform. Once she returned, a grateful nation showed its thanks with a hundred percent recycled ticker tape parade. But the job of defending democracy is never done. When we learned that our sacred American norms, yes, our norms, when we found that our norms faced a new and even more diabolical threat, an election hacks by Russian spies, lesser Members of Congress merely complained about it. They held hearings and stuff. Not Sandy, she flew right to Moscow and did something brave. Here she is in the ring, boxing face-to-face with Vladimir Putin himself. One bruising round, victory by knockout. But Sandy didn't waste time celebrating with some fancy champagne party. Back home, her country needed her. Thanks to climate change, America had to be knocked down and rebuilt completely from the ground up. Older and paler lawmakers held boring debates about infrastructure funding. Those meant nothing to Sandy, she got to work. Here she is casually eating a healthy lunch on a steel girder high above city streets with her fellow diverse blue collar working people friends, as she constructed the LEED- certified Empire State Building. Look carefully at that picture, not a harness or a net insight. Sometimes the need is so great, there isn't time for safety. Could Sandy have fallen hundreds of stories to her death below while eating her kale and Portobello pita? Of course she could have. But she didn't think about that, not while millions of our most vulnerable continue to die in earthquakes caused by climate change. As Sandy often says on Instagram, it's about priorities, and her priority now is saving the human race from extinction. And not just the human race, the animal race, too. Sandy is no speciesist. Within weeks, scientists tell us, Central Park will be crowded with millions of homeless sweating polar bears fleeing the melting icecaps up north. Who will lead the polar bears home? We think you know. Everything we just showed you can be found on the internet and is therefore true. Unfortunately, in this fallen world, it is possible that unscrupulous right-wing racists will attempt to undermine or mischaracterize with information some of these achievements. In case that happens, we encourage you to notify our donors at Google and Facebook and have those people silenced immediately. Thank you. What happened to GameStop stock last week wasn't just about Wall Street, it was a battle bigger than that, a battle about censorship and control of the economy and it hasn't ended. One of the founders of PayPal has thought a lot about the implications of what we've been watching. David Sacks joins us after the break. CARLSON: The President's son, Hunter Biden has a new memoir coming out in April, pretty soon. The publisher Simon & Schuster promises it will be quote, ""heartfelt."" Trace Gallagher has that story for us. Hey, Trace. TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Tucker, your header at the bottom of the screen there, the book is called ""Beautiful Thing."" It's about Hunter Biden's experience with drug addiction. A quote from the book says, quoting here: ""I come from a family forged by tragedies and bound by remarkable unbreakable love."" And here's the best part. It's being published by Gallery Books, which is actually an imprint of Simon & Schuster. If you go back, you'll recall that's the same company that refused to publish Senator Josh Hawley's book. So the question now becomes: how much will the President's son be getting for this book? Well, sources now tell FOX News, it will be somewhere in the high six figures. So the same man accused of trying to profit off his father's name, those accusations by the way the media refuse to cover is now profiting off his father's name and everybody is covering it. And just for the record, Hunter's finances remain under investigation by the Department of Justice. The word is, he may need the extra money and for clarity, just a few months ago, Hunter Biden was trying to become an artist. He apparently has decided that being an author is a lot more lucrative -- Tucker CARLSON: He is probably right. Trace Gallagher, great to see you tonight. Thank you. GALLAGHER: Yes. CARLSON: So as you recall, just last week, people on Reddit nearly bankrupted a famous hedge fund. They did that by using a strategy that hedge funds have used for years. They shorted stock and companies like GameStop and drove them up for that purpose. Now of course, only hedge funds were allowed to manipulate the stock market, so corporations turned to a familiar tool. They censored the people on Reddit. The online service Discord, for example, accused the Reddit day traders of hate speech, and then there were the questions around Robinhood, which is the service they use to conduct those trades. All of this is filled with lessons for the rest of us. We're not financial experts, we're talking to someone now who is. David Sacks is a technology entrepreneur, very well-known in that world. He cofounded PayPal. He wrote a really smart piece about the implications of the story. You can find on the online publishing platform, Persuasion. We wanted to talk to him tonight. David, thanks so much for coming on. DAVID SACKS, COFOUNDER, PAYPAL: Hey, Tucker. CARLSON: So you have the grounding in this world sufficient, I think, to draw informed conclusions about what happened and what it means for everybody else. What have you concluded? SACKS: Sure. Well, Tucker, you know, you've been warning about censorship and the slippery slope when people start to invoke censorship, and I think we see it here with Discord. You have a case here where some Wall Street traders, their message board was taken down and they weren't engaging in political speech at all, they were engaging in a plan to give these Wall Street predators a taste of their own medicine. Because of that, they were very threatening to the people in power and they were accused of hate speech and they were taken down. Now, if you were to actually go into these message boards, you wouldn't see hate speech, you would see a lot of very raunchy speech, but nothing that's too different than what you'd see on a trading floor or boiler room on Wall Street, you know, and all of a sudden, these sort of titans of Wall Street is shocked, shocked by the language that's going on here. So you know, look, this is a really good example, I think of when you strip away sort of partisan issues, you see that the real purpose of censorship as a tool for the people in power to keep the outsiders out. CARLSON: I think that's really smart. So when they invoke the phrase hate speech, especially of all the phrases they use, I think it's the scariest. Nobody wants to be thought of as a hater or even using hate speech, that's an awful thing. Right? That's certainly how I feel. But what you're saying is they don't employ that in order to protect the weak, they use that phrase in order to protect the strong. SACKS: Yes, exactly. I mean, hate speech is a very malleable term, and so the people who get to decide what it means, which is really always the issue of censorship is who decides who has that power. CARLSON: Right. SACKS: It's the people in power who get to decide what it means. And so, you know, you had a case here, where look, these message boards weren't set up for the purpose of organizing hate or even any political topic, they were organized to talk about a trade and they, you know, figured out actually a plan that work perfectly to execute a short squeeze and these hedge funds lost $20 billion. And so they were, you know, in a lot of trouble, a lot of financial distress, and they were looking for a way out. And so the way they -- they found a way out, it was to go through these message boards. They screenshot any post that could plausibly be characterized as hate speech, they report it, and then they get the site taken down. And so this is kind of where the slippery slope of censorship goes, is that whenever outsiders become too threatening to powerful insiders, the insiders use censorship as a weapon. They weaponize these speech rules to prevent the threat. CARLSON: So you're making a very traditional liberal argument. I mean, you're saying what the ACLU said for about a hundred years what -- you know, Nat Hentoff used to write about in ""The Village Voice."" SACKS: Yes. CARLSON: Why aren't more people saying that now, do you think? More people empowered with authority. SACKS: Well, it's a really good question, Tucker, and I think part of it is that a lot of the people in power are, frankly, threatened by these new social networks. And so certainly the traditional media has been very upset with social networks and social media because of its threat to their influence and business model. You certainly saw these, you know, Wall Street Titans become very nervous that all of a sudden their control over the Monopoly board was threatened by these outsiders, these Reddit kids. CARLSON: Right. SACKS: And so frankly, the people in power don't have any reason to want to like social networks, because social networks allow large groups of outsiders to get together, and so they accuse social networking, ironically, of being a threat to democracy. But this isn't a threat. When you're talking about large numbers of people getting together to organize for change, that is democracy. That's not a threat to democracy. What it is, is a potential threat to the people in power, and that's why they don't like it. CARLSON: Man, I mean, you're one of the people who built sort of the internet that we use, and you're saying what people said 20 years ago when they built it. You are about the only one still saying it though, which is this is supposed to democratize things and empower normal people. No one else seems to believe that except you anymore, but I appreciate that you do. David Sacks, thank you. SACKS: Thank you. CARLSON: We appreciate your watching tonight. Our hour is done. We are the only that stands up for free speech in this moment. I hope that this moment doesn't last long, but as of tonight, that's where we are. We will be back 8:00 p.m. every weeknight, the show that is the sworn enemy of lying pomposity, smugness, and groupthink. And so at 9:00 p.m. Eastern, the Great Sean Hannity takes over from New York. Classification"
2021-02-10,"TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening, and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. It's funny how change happens. You thought the big change came on Election Day. That's when the incumbent President lost, but that turned out to be nothing compared to the change that came two months later. On January 6th, supporters of Donald Trump swarmed the Capitol Building, some forced their way inside, and Washington has never been the same. It may never be the same. As a result of what happened on January 6th, your descendants will live in a very different country. It was a pivot point in our history looking back. Some in Congress have compared that day to 9/11. The Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has likened it to Pearl Harbor, the day that spurred America's entry into the Second World War. Every day we hear new and more florid comparisons from Democratic partisans. But last night, CNN outdid all of them. Chernobyl? The Bhopal disaster? The Irish Potato Famine? No. What happened on January 6th was worse than any of that. It was, CNN told us, very much like the Rwandan genocide. ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST: The idea of other rising people is something I think we saw a lot of over the last four years. I mean, certainly we've seen a lot over the last decades, but it's so easy to otherwise people, to make people other than, other than American, other than patriotic other than human, you know, and we've seen it in Bosnia, we've seen it in Rwanda where the radio was telling people that you know, Hutus, were telling the radio listeners that Tutsi were cockroaches, for -- you know, getting them ginned up for genocide. CARLSON: The Rwandan genocide, that's what it was like. Keep in mind that close to a million people were murdered in Rwanda in 1994. That's about 70 percent of all ethnic Tutsis in the country. Entire towns were hacked to death with machetes, they were set on fire, crushed alive by bulldozers. Hundreds of thousands of women were raped. It was among the most horrifying crimes in human history. How does a country recover from something like that? From a genocide? Well, first, obviously, you punish the guilty quickly and severely. In our case, you impeach him. But then -- and this is more important -- you set about reordering your society from top to bottom to make certain nothing like that ever happens again. So you purge the military, you suspend basic civil liberties. To emphasize the point, you send troops to the Capitol. You tear down the old, you destroy all vestiges of the past in order to save the future. That's what's going on now. But hold on, before we remake America to prevent future genocide at the Capitol, maybe we should know a little bit more about the crime that occurred on January 6th, if only to understand the justification for overturning our lives permanently. What exactly did happen that day? Simple question. You may be surprised to learn how little we know even now. In fact, it's remarkable how many of the most basic questions remain unanswered more than a month after the fact. Let's start with the headline of the day. Five Americans died on the Capitol grounds on January 6th. You've heard that, you hear it incessantly including from Republican officeholders -- five dead. But that doesn't really tell you very much. It's the details as always that matter. Who were these people and how did they die? That's how you understand what actually happened. So with that in mind, here are the facts as of tonight. Four of the five who died that day were Trump supporters. The fifth was a Capitol Hill police officer who apparently also supported Donald Trump. Why is this relevant? Of course, the political views of the deceased shouldn't matter. But unfortunately, in this case, they do. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and many other elected Democrats claimed the mob was coming for them that day. Yet, the only recorded casualties on January 6th were people who voted for Donald Trump. The first among them was the 34-year-old woman from Georgia called Rosanne Boyland. Authorities first announced that Boyland died of a quote, ""medical emergency."" Later, video footage suggested she may have accidentally been trampled by the crowd. We're still not sure, that's the best guess. The second casualty was 55-year-old, Kevin Greeson. Greeson died of heart failure while talking to his wife on a cell phone outside the Capitol. Quote, ""Kevin had a history of high blood pressure,"" his wife later said, "" ... and in the midst of the excitement, he suffered a heart attack,"" end quote. The third was 50-year-old Benjamin Phillips of Ringtown, Pennsylvania. Phillips was a Trump supporter who organized a bus trip to Washington for the rally that day. He died of a stroke on the grounds of the Capitol. There is no evidence that Phillips rioted or was injured by rioters or even when inside the Capitol Building. The fourth person to die, the only person to die that day of intentional violence was 35-year-old, Ashli Babbitt, a military veteran from San Diego. Babbitt was wearing a Trump cape when she was shot to death by a Capitol Hill police lieutenant. Babbitt's death was caught on video, so hers is the best documented death that took place that day. And yet it is surprising how little we know about it. Babbitt was shot as she tried to crawl through a broken window into the Speaker's lobby within the Capitol, and that's essentially the extent of what we know. Authorities have refused to release the name of the man who shot her or divulge any details of the investigation they say they've done. We may never know exactly why this unnamed Capitol Hill police officer took her life. According to that officer's attorney quote, ""There is no way to look at the evidence and think that he is anything but a hero."" Of course, we can't actually look at that evidence because they're withholding it, we can't even know his identity. Killing an unarmed woman may be justified under certain specific circumstances, but since when is it quote, ""heroic""? When the dead woman has read QAnon websites? Republicans aren't asking that question. One Republican Member of Congress from Oklahoma says he immediately hugged the officer who shot Ashli Babbitt. ""You did what you had to do,"" the Congressman said. But did the officer really have to do that? We don't know. It would be nice to know, maybe someone could ask. We do know that Ashli Babbitt was not holding a weapon when she was killed. Nevertheless, at the impeachment hearing this week, Congressman David Cicilline of Rhode Island described what happened at the Capitol as quote, ""an armed insurrection."" Watch. REP. DAVID CICILLINE (D-RI): He incited an armed, angry mob to riot. ... and inciting an armed insurrection against the United States government. ... an armed, angry and dangerous crowd -- ... armed violence against the government of the United States of America. CARLSON: David Cicilline is a former mafia lawyer from Providence, so presumably he knows what it is to commit a felony with a firearm. That is what he does. There are no reports of rioters at the Capitol Building that day discharging weapons or threatening anyone with a gun. So what exactly is David Cicilline talking about? Well, apparently, he is referring to the death of Officer Brian Sicknick. In the hours after the riot, ""The New York Times"" reported that Trump supporters had brutally beaten Officer Sicknick to death with a fire extinguisher. The fire extinguisher apparently is the deadly weapon, the armed in the armed insurrection. Now the news of Sicknick's death by violence was quickly picked up by countless other media outlets. Cable television anchors repeated and then amplified it. ANA CABRERA, CNN HOST: Officer Brian Sicknick died after being hit in the head with a fire extinguisher during the hours' long attack. NICOLLE WALLACE, MSNBC ANCHOR: They beat a Capitol Police officer to death with a fire extinguisher. COOPER: Officer Brian Sicknick died after being hit in the head with a fire extinguisher during the fight. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He died at the age of 42 after he was bludgeoned with a fire extinguisher. CARLSON: Capitol Hill police officer beaten to death with a fire extinguisher by a white supremacist mob. It's horrifying. And that is the story they were telling. It's a story they still are telling. That account forms the basis of the myth that Democrats have constructed around January 6th. Sicknick's remains lay in state at the Capitol Building, streams of politicians, the very same people who just months before had told us that cops were racist by definition, those same people praised Brian Sicknick as a hero. They had finally found a police officer who served their political uses. Kamala Harris and her husband, for example, arrived to pay their respects and as they did, they said not one thing about defunding the police. But in fact, the story they told was a lie, from beginning to end. Officer Sicknick was not beaten to death, not with a fire extinguisher, not with anything else. According to an exhaustive and fascinating new analysis on Revolver News, there is no evidence that Brian Sicknick was hit with a fire extinguisher at any point during the day. None. No video. Nothing. The officer's body apparently bore no signs of trauma. In fact, on the night of January 6, long after rioters at the Capitol had been arrested or dispersed, Brian Sicknick texted his brother from his office. According to his brother, Sicknick said he'd been quote, ""Pepper sprayed twice and he was in good shape."" Twenty four hours later, Officer Brian Sicknick was dead. How did Officer Sicknick die? The head of the Capitol Police Union has said he had a stroke, no cause given. More than that, we still don't know. Sicknick's body was cremated immediately. Authorities have refused to release his autopsy. No one has been charged in his death. No charges are pending. Whatever happened to Brian Sicknick was tragic, obviously. But it was also very different from what they have told us. They have lied about how he died. They've lied about a lot. For example, how did this riot start? Was it a spontaneous event incited by a reckless President on his way out in a fit of vicious peak? That's one version of the story. Or was the riot long planned? Was it a conspiracy? That's another version of the story. Both cannot be true. This weekend the former Chief of the Capitol Hill police Steven Sund claimed in a letter to Nancy Pelosi that there was no Intelligence suggesting that a riot might be imminent at the Capitol. Apparently, ""The Washington Post"" has better sources than Chief Sund does. Days after January 6th, the newspaper reported that it was well known that a group of Trump supporters was headed to the city to cause trouble. The F.B.I. almost certainly knew this. The Feds likely had paid informers in the ranks of protesters. One of the rioters, we learned this yesterday, was a former F.B.I. employee. Was he still on the F.B.I. payroll? He wouldn't be the first. So if the authorities knew that violence might be coming to the Capitol, where was the necessary security? It wasn't there. In fact, the response of law enforcement on the scene that day is baffling the more deeply you look into it. In some publicly available videos, Capitol Hill Police seemed to be all but inviting rioters into the building. Here's one example. CARLSON: What does all of this mean exactly? We're not sure what it means, and we're not going to speculate. We do know for certain that the known facts of what happened on January 6th deviate in very important ways from the story they are now telling us, including the story they told us today in the impeachment hearings. And in many places, the known facts bear no resemblance to the story they are telling. They're just flat out lying. There's no question about that. The question is, why would they lie about this? For an answer, think back to last spring. Beginning on Memorial Day, BLM and their sponsors in Corporate America completely changed this country. They changed this country more in five months than it had changed in the previous 50 years. How did they do that? They used the sad death of a man called George Floyd to upend our society. Months later, we learned that the story they told us about George Floyd's death was an utter lie. There was no physical evidence that George Floyd was murdered by a cop. The autopsy showed that George Floyd almost certainly died of a drug overdose - - fentanyl. But by that point, facts didn't matter. It was too late. Cities had been destroyed along with the fabric of this country itself. Scores of people had been killed. Democratic partisans used a carefully concocted myth, a lie, to bum rush America into overturning the old order and handing them much more power. It worked flawlessly. So why wouldn't they do it again? Joining us from Los Angeles is a man who watched all of this happen, the radio show host and all around great observer and analyst and man, Larry Elder. Larry, great to see you tonight. LARRY ELDER, RADIO SHOW HOST, SALEM RADIO NETWORK: Thank you so much for having me, Tucker, I appreciate it. CARLSON: It's hard not to feel -- and I'm not alleging conspiracy because it's happening in plain sight -- but it is hard not to feel like a historic event, January 6th, which no person would ever defend, is being used by political partisans to gather more power to themselves and the rest of us are letting it happen. ELDER: Well, Tucker, everything you said about needing more facts, of course, is rational. It's reasonable, and it is completely irrelevant because Donald Trump has been impeached twice and is now standing his second impeachment trial for the unpardonable capital offense, capital felony of being Donald Trump. The left thinks Donald Trump himself is a crime scene. Look at some of the characters involved in this play. Maxine Waters: everybody knows Maxine Waters urged supporters to threaten Donald Trump Cabinet members. She said ""Push back on them, surround them, form a crowd. Let them know they're not welcome anywhere anymore."" Forget about that. This is a woman who wrote a letter to Fidel Castro when Congress passed a resolution urging Castro to send back to America a woman who had murdered a New Jersey Trooper, broke out of prison and fled to Cuba. Maxine Waters writes Castro a letter likens her to a freedom fighter. She is a former Black Panther and says that the only reason she was prosecuted is because she had been persecuted for political beliefs and urged Castro to keep this woman. She remains there as we speak. Chuck Schumer, of course, is going to vote to convict President Trump. Chuck Schumer has often played the race card. When asked whether or not Donald Trump is a racist, he said, ""Well, he had said racist things."" In 1974 a young, upcoming ambitious politician named Chuck Schumer met with some racist neighbors in an area in New York called Flatbush. There were two buildings, Tucker, they had black tenants. They weren't causing any problems. They weren't committing any crimes. But these racist neighbors wanted them out. The young Schumer met with the neighbors and he said look, here's what I'll do. Vote for me and I'll introduce a measure to renovate these buildings. They'll have a right of first refusal of course, but we will make them so nice they won't be able to afford to come back. And voila, he introduced the scheme to do that. Unfortunately, for Schumer and the racist neighbors, the blacks were able to come up with the money to move back into digs that were nicer than the digs they left, but not for want of trying. Now, the man who was attending this meeting is named Jay Homnick. He's a writer Tucker, for ""American Spectator."" He wrote about this in 2006. I've interviewed him several times over the years on my radio show. And I've asked him, has anybody from ""The New York Times"" or ""The Washington Post"" asked you about this? He said, no, the media are completely uninterested in this racist scheme to purge the New York neighborhood in 1974 of black people. Now, in 1974, it is a long time ago, I'll give you that. But that's the same time that Donald Trump, a young Donald Trump and into a consent decree with the F.H.A. to discontinue practices that the F.H.A. felt were discriminatory against would be black and brown winters. And that is often cited as a reason for Donald Trump's alleged racism. Around the same time, Chuck Schumer introduced this racist scheme to purge a New York neighborhood of black people, and nobody gives a damn. This is the kind of double standard that we've been up against for years, and I am sick of it. I am sick of it. These characters involved in getting rid of Donald Trump, impeaching him and now convicted him have done horrific things and the media could not care less. Who writes a letter to Castro? Who in 1974 introduces a plan to get rid of black people? Who does that? Media indifferent. CARLSON: Hard to take a moral lecture from these people, I completely agree. They win because they scream louder. They are more aggressive. ELDER: It is. CARLSON: That's totally true. Larry Elder, it is great to see you tonight. Thank you for that. ELDER: It is. Thank you, Tucker. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it. CARLSON: Thank you. So Mark Cuban is a billionaire. Mark Cuban is not a genius. You think that would make him very grateful for America, a country where geniuses and people who are not geniuses can make a billion dollars, but it's not. He is not grateful. He has just announced that his NBA team is no longer playing the National Anthem. You're not going to hear it anymore. That's how much he dislikes the country that made him rich. We've got details after the break. CARLSON: Mark Cuban is a billionaire. He owns the Dallas Mavericks, the NBA team. Like other NBA owners, Mark Cuban makes a lot of his money in China and that's why according to Mark Cuban, the non-genius billionaire, it is fine for China to commit genocide. They're good customer says Mark Cuban. But when Mark Cuban hears the United States National Anthem, he takes a different position. He is disgusted by it. He wants to take a knee. That's how awful this country is. MARK CUBAN, OWNER OF DALLAS MAVERICKS: If they were taking a knee and they were being respectful, I'll be proud of them. You know, hopefully, you know I'd join them because I think we've learned a lot since 2017. I think we've evolved as a country, and this is really a unique point in time where we can grow as a society, we can grow as a country and become far more inclusive. CARLSON: Well, this week in the name of inclusivity, and making China happy, by the way, when you include people, it almost always means excluding them, Mark Cuban has decided the National Anthem can no longer be played before any home game in Dallas. The NBA initially supported this decision, but this afternoon, the NBA changed its mind. The league released a statement quote, ""All teams will play the National Anthem in keeping with long standing league policy."" Will Cain is the co-host of ""FOX & Friends"" Weekend. We're happy to have him on tonight. Will, good to see you. WILL CAIN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL COHOST, ""FOX & FRIENDS"": Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: So it seems to me the NBA could have said, you know, it's not just long standing policy, we -- you know, we kind of appreciate the country where our sport was invented and that sustains us. Why not take the chance to kind of defend America in the face of the attack on it? CAIN: Because that would be unfashionable, Tucker. The fashionable point of view and the one that Mark Cuban seems to have adopted perhaps because some of his employees hold this point of view, perhaps some of his players hold his point of view, but it's certainly a radical point of view, is that America is irredeemably flawed, that were defined by original sin of slavery and the residual racism. And so it's fashionable to believe that America's symbols, her flag, her National Anthem, therefore, are politically divisive. Of course, you and I know that's not true. I think most people know that's not true. The United States is a unique experiment in human history. We're defined by our aspirations, our goals, by our documents, like the Constitution, and ultimately, Tucker, we know those are unifying elements, unifying symbols. But Mark seems to have adopted this idea and it is totally dictated by the terms of the left that the United States, its symbols are divisive, that we see the worst in America, and therefore we must cancel all of these symbols that the rest of us see as our aspirations and our unifying factors. That's why they won't take a principled stand. CARLSON: I think that's really smart and nicely expressed. I mean, those symbols amount to our culture and our culture is the only thing that unites us. I mean, without a common culture, what do we have at that point? CAIN: Right. And I'll tell you something more than that. Part of that culture is sports. I love sports, Tucker. If you know anything about me, you know, I came from the world of sports. I believe it brings us together across racial barriers, across socioeconomic barriers. We arbitrarily root for these ridiculous jerseys and laundry that we grew up around. I love the Mavericks. By the way, I'm coming to you live from Dallas. I'm from the DFW area. I'm a lifelong Mavericks fan. I suffered through the 90s. I celebrated the Dirk years. I'm excited about Luca Doncic. If Mark is watching, I'm a true heartfelt fan of the Dallas Mavericks. But if you make me choose between the United States of America and the Mavericks, it will not be a hard choice. CARLSON: Nicely put. Will, it's good to see you tonight. Thank you for coming on. CAIN: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: Of course, Mark Cuban and the other decadent moron like him was always invited on the show to explain his point of view. Joe Biden is pushing to raise the Federal minimum wage to $15.00 an hour. That may help some of the people who get raised wages, it will definitely hurt others. According to Congressional Budget Office, a $15.00 minimum wage would eliminate almost a million and a half jobs and increase the Federal deficit dramatically. Neil Patel has thought a lot about this topic. He wrote a column about it for the Boston Herald. He is the publisher of ""The Daily Caller."" He joins us tonight to assess. Neil, thanks a lot for coming on. So economic arguments aside, it does seem like the minimum wage is popular in general with the public and this is likely to happen given who controls Congress. Given that, what's the wise way do you think to raise the minimum wage? NEIL PATEL, PUBLISHER, ""THE DAILY CALLER"": Tucker, thanks for having me. If you're going to have a minimum wage, it doesn't make any sense to have it the same in every location in America. It costs more than twice as much to live in Manhattan as it does in a small town in Kansas, and there is no earthly reason both those places should have the same minimum wage. Similarly, it doesn't make any sense to have the same minimum wage for huge multinational companies with thousands of employees, and billions of dollars in profits, as it does for say, the deli on the corner of your block at home. The deli owner is probably working in his own store, he may want a few hours off in the afternoon and bring in a high school kid. The concept of - - the left's concept of a livable wage, I think it's much easier to apply that to a Walmart or a Target than it is to the deli guy. And yet, we don't. We have one minimum wage applying in every place for every business, it makes zero sense. CARLSON: Could it have something to do with who donates to which political party? I mean, it seems like some of these big businesses would actually be in favor of a higher minimum wage if they thought it would drive their competitors out of business. PATEL: So the huge multinational companies that dominate Washington, and these policy debates are actually mostly for the minimum wage increase. The retailers, the big real retailers, like Target and Walmart, Amazon, they're definitely in for it. They're publicly in favor of it. And it's because it crushes their small business competitors. They can afford it. They're already mostly paying a $15.00 an hour wage, and they know that the ones they compete with, these small town businesses can't afford it. So that's another reason why, you know, why doesn't Washington call their bluff? How about $20.00 or more on huge multinationals, but $10.00 or less on the small business in the corner? CARLSON: I mean, this is pretty much the last thing after a year of COVID and riots that small businesses need right now, is it not? PATEL: It's the last thing small businesses need. It's the last thing our country needs. I don't know if you saw the stats today. Sixty percent of the people involved in the Capitol Hill riots had gone through extreme economic hardship recently -- meaning bankruptcies, massive credit, layoffs. So the problems we are having in our economy, especially in the small business sector, where small businesses just lost 30 percent of their revenue this year, and 30 percent of all small businesses just closed down. Washington needs to start looking at this and coming up with more innovative policies than ones that only are aligned with the big business agenda. CARLSON: It's such a smart point that I've heard from nobody else, $30.00 minimum wage for Amazon warehouse workers, no minimum wage for the dry cleaner on your block. I love that. Neil Patel, I appreciate you coming on tonight. Thank you. PATEL: Thank you, Tucker. CARLSON: Well, you may have thought that once the coronavirus vaccine arrived, you could visit your elderly relatives who were locked away in the hospital or a nursing home, but no. Our public health experts want you to know that the vaccine does not mean you're getting your freedom back, just the opposite. That's straight ahead. TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Live from ""America's News Headquarters,"" I'm Trace Gallagher. The first full day of arguments in the second impeachment trial against former President Trump has just wrapped up on Capitol Hill. House impeachment managers presenting previously unseen security video from the January 6th attack. It shows just how close the mob got to senators and Vice President Mike Pence. Trump's legal defense team which claims the trial is unconstitutional will get the chance to make their arguments later this week. To convict Trump on the single charge of inciting an insurrection, 17 Republicans would have to join all Democrats. Meantime in other news, ""Hustler"" Magazine founder and First Amendment rights advocate, Larry Flynt has died. Flynt's nephew says he died earlier today of heart failure at his Hollywood Hills home. Larry Flynt was 78 years old. When news breaks out. We'll break in. I'm Trace Gallagher. Now back to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. CARLSON: You thought the coronavirus vaccine would change your life? You thought for example, you could finally see your elderly relatives, but the goalposts have moved again. A Northwestern Medical School Professor called June McKoy told NPR this week that your parents should stay isolated until we achieve herd immunity. McKoy warned, and we're quoting here, ""You still pose a clear and present danger to your parents,"" despite the vaccine. Dr. Marc Siegel is a FOX News medical contributor. Of course, we're happy to have him join us tonight to assess this. Doctor, good to see you. DR. MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR: Tucker, good to see you. When you move the goalposts, hope is replaced by despair and public health needs to be consistent. And a lot of emphasis will put on these vaccines, which is why I'm really glad to see Dr. Mitch Katz, of all people, who is the CEO of Health and Hospitals Corporation right here in failing New York City, the right arm of Mayor Bill de Blasio, say on Monday at a press conference, hey, this vaccine, I'm extremely excited about it. It works, and it's the way back. He said it's the way back and he also said, ""My 98-year-old father,"" he said, "" ... and my 93-year-old mother are now going to take visitors from their children."" I was so happy to see that, Tucker, especially when you consider what is public health anyway? It's an overall cost, isn't it? And there was a big study out of Boston in September that said that 25 percent of Americans are suffering from clinical depression. That means that 75 or 100 percent of Americans, that's you and me and everyone have some kind of anxiety or depression and it is permeating us not to have hope, and this vaccine meant hope. And I have to admit something to you tonight, Tucker, that I'm embarrassed to admit, which is last spring, as you know, my parents had COVID-19, but when they came back to New York, I was permeated with a fear, too. I met them on the porch. I was afraid to come too close, even though I knew they were immune. I knew they were immune, and I knew I could come close, wear my mask, come close. But I was afraid for more than a 10-minute visit. But I'm happy to report tonight, Tucker. My father has had the vaccine. My mother has had the vaccine. I've had the vaccine, Tucker. Hey, Dad, I'm hopping on a plane and I'm coming to see you. I'll wear my mask, but I'm coming to see you -- Tucker. CARLSON: Have a great reunion. Dr. Siegel, good to see you tonight. Thank you. SIEGEL: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: Well, according to some of our public health experts, everything that happens -- good or bad -- is more proof that we need more lockdown. As coronavirus cases go up, we need more lockdowns. If they go down, you know what that means? More lockdowns because that's science. CABRERA: We've seen this before, metrics improve, states rollback restrictions. A few weeks later, cases spike. What goes through your mind when you see states rollback restrictions right now? Is it -- are we in the clear? DR. JONATHAN REINER, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST: Oh, no, this is such a bad idea. Who slows down once you break into the lead? It makes zero sense. CARLSON: So the Biden ministration is taking this advice seriously. Instead of reopening all of the schools right now as the science calls for, the White House has a new plan. They are promising that in a few months, about 50 percent of schools will be open and by open, they mean for one day a week. Well, that sounds terrible for kids, just relax, that's how science works, and you have to make it up as you go along out of nothing. For example, just a year ago -- today, a year in the pandemic, the C.D.C. declared that everyone really should be wearing two masks. So if you're only wearing one, you're a science denier. Alex Berenson knows this routine well. He is the author of ""Unreported Truths about COVID-19 and Lockdowns Part Three: Masks."" He joins us tonight from an undisclosed location. Alex, it's great to see you tonight. What -- so you've been calling for schools to reopen on the basis of the actual science for quite some time. What do you make of where we are now? ALEX BERENSON, AUTHOR: It is -- it is absurd. And, you know, it's been obvious actually, since last May really, arguably late April that schools should be open. You know, in places like Australia, they were talking about reopening schools that early. The Biden plan is ridiculous. It actually is a step back, believe it or not, from where we are right now. The reason Joe Biden doesn't want to call for an immediate reopening of schools is he knows he can't do it. Donald Trump tried that and he failed. Donald Trump was not beholden to the teachers union, so it didn't cost him anything, except embarrassment, I guess or it just showed that he couldn't do it. For Biden, he will anger his constituency. He'll look weak. So he's not going to do anything that's going to anger the teachers unions, instead, he is going to have these ridiculous metrics that can't be met, and you know, meanwhile, every day goes by is another day when tens of millions of kids don't get socialized, don't get to see their friends. Don't get, you know, don't get potentially out of abusive homes. CARLSON: Yes. I've got to ask you something. I just -- I just -- because I can't control myself, and it's about you specifically. So you've been on this show for almost a year. I've never asked for your politics. You used to work at ""The New York Times."" BERENSON: Yes. CARLSON: You're a novelist. I assume you're a Democrat? Don't answer. BERENSON: Yes. CARLSON: But I don't think you're any kind of right-winger, okay. I never have been. You've been talking about science for almost a year on the show, and because of that, people have really started to be mad at you. You're also a novelist. Tell me like what effect is speaking out about what the data tell you had on your life? I just can't -- I can't resist asking you. BERENSON: So Tucker, you know, the data -- listen, I wrote a book that came out yesterday, that book is called ""The Power Couple."" It's a novel, it's got nothing to do with COVID. I wrote it before COVID. I wrote it in 2018 and 2019. I cannot get anybody to cover that book. ""The New York Times"" -- all the places that covered all the previous novels that I wrote for the last 15 years won't cover it. And I can only surmise that that's because they don't like what I'm saying about COVID, that I'm not on the train, that I point out the problems with masks that I've recently been talking about the question of whether vaccines are as efficacious as you know as a clinical trial data made them seem. All the stuff that is science based, they don't like and so they can't hit at me because I don't work for them anymore. But they can prevent me from getting any publicity for ""The Power Couple."" And now -- and I haven't, and it hurts me a little bit. But you know what? I'm a big boy, those are the rules of the game, we'll move on. I'll keep telling the truth. CARLSON: I hope maybe some time, you will take your ample energies and think through and write a book maybe on what this is about. How did science get so political? Why does quoting studies make you persona non grata in certain parts of the country? I think it would just be interesting to hear about that. Good luck. BERENSON: Yes, my next book will be nonfiction, I can tell you that. CARLSON: Good. Congrats on the novel. Good to see you. BERENSON: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: Well, women's rights, their most basic rights like to be acknowledged as females are under attack in this country, but what we're seeing is not unprecedented, it has happened before. It is happening on a large scale in Europe. Ayaan Hirsi Ali has seen it. She knows what it is. She joins us next to explain it. CARLSON: Cases of sexual violence against women appear to be rising rapidly in many parts of Europe in measurable ways. Why is this happening? Ayaan Hirsi Ali, our old friend is one of the very few people who seems to be trying to understand why. She is a Research Fellow at the Hoover Institution, author of the new book ""Prey: Immigration, Islam and the Erosion of Women's Rights."" She joins us tonight to explain. Ayaan, thanks so much for coming on. So is this happening? Do we know for a fact it is happening? And if we do then, why do you think it is happening? AYAAN HIRSI ALI, RESEARCH FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION: It's happening because the people who are elected to manage immigration in Europe have failed to do that. Elected officials have pretended that they were managing immigration, but they weren't. There are large numbers of people that are coming from the Middle East, from Africa, from South Asia and most of them are young men, and when they come to Europe, they behave in exactly the same ways that they behave towards their own women, and elected officials pretend that there is a policy when there isn't. And women are affected, and other vulnerable groups. For instance, minorities such as homosexuals, Jewish people. This has been going on for decades. Now, the subject of my book ""Prey"" is focusing on women's issues. CARLSON: Yes. ALI: But the real truth is that sexual violence against women and especially, Tucker, against women who live in low-income neighborhoods are affected more than other women, and that's why the whole #MeToo Movement hasn't gone there, but this is a story of incompetence -- incompetence of elected officials. CARLSON: Some of these countries in Scandinavia for example, apparently have lied about the rape rates, tried to suppress public understanding of what's actually happening. Is that to cover their own mistakes or sins, do you think? Why would they do that? ALI: So not all countries are the same. CARLSON: Yes. ALI: Countries like Denmark are actually doing a great job of saying okay, we have a problem. We have to do something about it. We have to work on integration. And when they say integration, that really means spelling out that there is such a thing as national identity and national values. And here's how we treat our women, and if you're coming from some other country and you have a different attitude to women, we're happy to invest in programs where we can teach you, and we want to make you a part of the society. If you fail to do that, there'll be consequences. But there are basket cases like Sweden, where they're not doing that. And it's not just Scandinavia, it is wider Europe. There are areas in France, in Germany, in the United Kingdom, in any country that has had a substantial number of immigrants from Muslim majority countries, where you're seeing neighborhoods that have become women-free zones, and these women-free zones, mainly working class, you know, women who are affected in this way. And first, it was immigrant women, and we've had these debates and activism and it took quite a bit of time to convince these people and say, you know what, female genital mutilation, child marriage, all of this. So we looked away from immigrant women and how they were affected. Now, all women are being affected in the public space, but mainly working class women, so it is really -- the big picture story is that our elected officials in Europe are really failing to manage these migration, this large movement of people and we're not having those conversations. And here -- here we are. CARLSON: I hope that your book will start that conversation. I appreciate your bravery and your honesty. Ayaan Hirsi Ali, thank you very much, and congrats on that book, ""Prey."" ALI: Tucker, thank you very much for having me. CARLSON: Pete Buttigieg is little, but he's deep. He is a man with deep thoughts. Now that he is the Secretary of Transportation, the nation's roads and railways are like the pen and paper of his mind. He has produced some new insights. We'll share those with you if you can handle them. That's straight ahead. ANNOUNCER: And now, deep thoughts with Mayor Pete. PETE BUTTIGIEG, U.S. TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY: It's not a sizzling glamorous issue, but the shape of our democracy is the issue that affects every other issue. CARLSON: That was the elven Pete Buttigieg, professional Barack Obama impersonator, former mayor of South Bend. That was him in February. The rest of world did not recognize his intellect at the time, but we did. Now finally, the world has caught up with what's going on inside his head. Pete Buttigieg is the Secretary of Transportation now, the most coveted job among America's best and brightest. All the McKinsey alums want it. Already, Secretary Pete is transporting us into another world, a world where everyone is free to walk in the middle of the highway. QUESTION: What's the biggest way that transportation has been permanently changed by the pandemic? BUTTIGIEG: It's too soon to know for sure. But I think it's safe to say that our old patterns of life, the nine to five, Monday through Friday commuting patterns are not going to be exactly the same. QUESTION: Yes. And so how might that change what your staff does? BUTTIGIEG: You know, we think trains, planes and automobiles, but what about bikes, scooters, wheelchairs, for that matter? QUESTION: Those are things you plan to pay more attention to? BUTTIGIEG: Absolutely, yes. Look, roads aren't only for vehicles. We've got to make sure that pedestrians and individuals, bicyclists and businesses can all coexist on the same roadway. CARLSON: That's right, man. They're not just for vehicles. Businesses live in highways, too. Mark Steyn is a bestselling author. He likes the sidewalk. He joins us tonight to assess this. What do you make of this, Mark? MARK STEYN, AUTHOR AND COLUMNIST: Well, he is deep. I mean, he was prescient in that shape of our democracy thing because it turned out our democracy was not quite as shapely as it ought to have been, so I'm with him on that. What he means here, I have no idea. I assume somewhere in the back of his mind, he is thinking that I-95 could be turned into one giant wheelchair ramp for seniors from Andrew Cuomo's blood soaked old folks homes fleeing New York for Florida. That would be a transformative idea for a young Cabinet minister trying to make his mark at the Department of Transportation. That would be great. I'm all in favor that. CARLSON: So ADA accessible interstate highways, that's the future. STEYN: Yes, I think so. I mean, what he was -- I mean, we were -- in some states such as Vermont, you already have bicycle lanes down the middle of town roads. Why not have that also on interstate highways? The bike-pathization of America, he is onto it. CARLSON: That is so deep. Mark Steyn, as always, great to see you. We'll be back tomorrow. Thank you, Mark -- 8:00 p.m., the show that's the sworn enemy of lying pomposity, smugness and groupthink. Sean Hannity next. Have a great night. Classification"
2021-01-29,"TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening, and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. Happy Friday. What a week. A lot going on in this country right now, but maybe the single biggest mystery when you take three steps back is why Democrats became so vicious after they won. So, Joe Biden got the White House, his party took the Congress, you'd think they'd be thrilled. That's what they wanted. You think they'd be celebrating? But no. Instead they started a purge. Within hours, Democrats began crushing even the mildest dissent. They shut down an entire social media company called Parler, not because Parler had done anything wrong, but simply because they couldn't control it. They couldn't take the chance that somebody on Parler might criticize them, so they eliminated it. Then two days ago, they arrested a man and threw him in handcuffs brought him up on federal charges because he made fun of Hillary Clinton on Twitter, that man is now facing 10 years in prison. Democrats then declared war on their rival political party, not by the way, a metaphorical war, but an actual one: soldiers and paramilitary law enforcement and the world's most powerful Intelligence Agencies. They denounced Republicans even the fairly moderate establishment figures who pose really no conceivable threat to anyone. They denounce them as dangerous terrorists, they linked them to ISIS and al Qaeda, and anyone who complained about this or fought back in any way, was threatened with expulsion from Congress. In other words, it doesn't matter what voters decided in November, in the name of democracy, you can no longer serve in the Congress. That's what they said. Nor are dissidents permitted in the Federal bureaucracy. No one who disagrees with our beliefs, Democrats have announced can work in the U.S. government. We're not overstating it; that all actually happened, and you saw it. Nothing like that has ever taken place in this country before. This is the most sweeping and audacious assault on civil liberties in American history. So, the question is, what accounts for this? Why are they doing it? It's worth figuring that out. On the most basic level, of course, it's a power grab. We said that from the first day and it remains true. The Democratic Party doesn't exist to serve some abstract principle, liberty and justice or the Bill of Rights. No. Nor is its primary goal improving the lives of its voters. If you've been to Detroit, you know that's true. No, the Democratic Party exists to accumulate power, all of it. Some is never enough. The impulse is to control everything. So that's what they're trying to do now amidst the chaos and tumult. But that's not all that's going on right now. There's more. Look around: watch as Democrats erect a permanent steel prison fence around the United States Capitol. Why is that fence there? Well, to protect the people inside, to keep the public out of what we used to call the People's House. That's happening tonight as we speak. Then notice the thousands of armed soldiers and law enforcement agents stationed outside that fence. What's their purpose? Again, protecting the people inside. Then ask yourself why are House Democrats planning to use Federal committee funds to pay for more personal security for themselves? Why the renewed push to seize firearms from law-abiding Americans who have committed no crime? Why does Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez seem on the verge of tears as she describes as she was almost murdered on January 6 at the Capitol. She is not entirely putting it on, she seems to mean it. If you're sensing a theme here, there is in fact a theme and the theme is panic, fear and it's real. You are looking at leaders who are genuinely afraid of the people they are supposed to be leading. Here's the really interesting thing: they seem much more afraid now that Donald Trump has left office. With Donald Trump gone, they sense that a period of actual populism has begun, real populism, and they may be right. Look at what happened this week on Wall Street. A group of guys on Reddit trading stocks in their boxer shorts exposed the entire American finance establishment as the corrupt and fraudulent scam that it often is. That's a pivotal moment in this country. Once you see something like that, you can't un-see it. Once someone pulls the mask from your face, he still remembers your face. People's attitudes about our economy will change forever because of what happened this week. It's a big deal. The Biden administration's response to what happened this week. Their first impulse was to brag about having the first female Treasury Secretary. That's what they said. That's not an adequate response to what happened, and even the Biden people know that it's not, but that's all they had. The truth is our leaders don't have answers. They don't even have explanations for what's going on. Worse than that, they themselves are deeply implicated in the systemic problems. In some cases, the crimes that are dragging the country down. They know all this. They know their guilt. Here's the thing: they know that you know it, too, and that's why they're afraid. They know why populism is rising, and it is. So, this really is the time to make a decision about how to respond to it. What our leaders do next will define what America looks like going forward. It wouldn't even be hard to begin the process of fixing things or bringing actual unity to a country that badly needs unity. In a democracy, the first step to unifying the country is always the same. Leaders enter into a power sharing agreement with the people they lead. They do the obvious thing, they stop lying to their own citizens, they stop attacking them, and they respect their culture. They don't try to control people's beliefs. That's not their role. They treat their own citizens like adults, meaning they treat them fairly. And above all, they cut the public in on some of the fruits of the country's success. If all the benefits of our economy seem to be accruing to a small number of people, that's a problem and they try hard to fix it. Wise leaders know that unequal countries are volatile countries. They know that caste systems are not compatible with democracies. But our leaders don't seem to know any of that. Instead, they tell us that solar cars and mandatory diversity training are the real solutions to our problems. But no one buys that, those are not real solutions, they are a smokescreen. They're a diversion tactic. Populism starts when people start to figure that out, and they have. And that's why everything suddenly feels so unstable right now, because once again, real populism is brewing. In the face of all of that, the people in charge are doing the single stupidest, most counterproductive thing that any leader could do in the face of a populist movement. They're refusing to admit their role in the decline. They're refusing to admit their failures, and instead, they are blaming the people they have failed. They're literally declaring war on their own population. How's that going to end? And if you think we're overstating it, we're not. Here's the former C.I.A. Director describing what the enemy looks like. JOHN BRENNAN, FORMER C.I.A. DIRECTOR: And this threat from domestic violence extremists is much more challenging, I believe, than it was in terms of going after foreign terrorists. The domestic violent extremists are much more pervasive, their numbers are much larger. When we're going after al Qaeda or other types of terrorist group cells in the United States, their numbers were in the single digits of dozens and was finding needles in a haystack. Here, there are a lot of haystacks with a lot of needles in them. They have the wherewithal, they already have the weapons that if they so choose to use them, they can in fact, carry out these deadly attacks. CARLSON: So many problems in this country, evident to anyone who is paying attention, but John Brennan, the former C.I.A. Director has isolated the real problem. The real problem is you. According to Brennan, anyone who disagrees with say, Susan Rice is worse than Osama bin Laden and more dangerous. These people meaning you, quote, ""Have the weapons,"" these terrorists. By terrorists, Brennan means tens of millions of American citizens who might have a firearm at home and didn't vote for Joe Biden. They're the threat and we need to hunt them as we hunted al Qaeda. You just saw the clip. That's what he said. It is hard to imagine a leader saying something more destructive and more reckless than that on television in a moment as fraught as the one we're in. It's terrifying in its stupidity, and in its certain effect. This isn't crying fire in a crowded theater, this is using a flame thrower in a crowded theater. What are the implications of a former C.I.A. Director talking like this? It's not going to make anyone more moderate. That's for certain, just the opposite. John Brennan is creating more extremists than a Pakistani madrasa. And it's not just him, all the news other than this one right now are repeating this now official line that the American government is now at war with its own population. Here is CNN's version. DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR: My colleague, Jim Sciutto, he has covered international terrorism for 20 years and says that the parallels to the domestic terror threat are frightening. And he points to and I quote here, ""radicalization online, demonization of the enemy to justify violence, draw to a cause greater than themselves devotion to a cultish leader."" That said, are we doing enough to combat this threat? JIM SCIUTTO, CNN ANCHOR: This is the way law enforcement looks at the domestic terror threat now is equal or greater than international terrorism. If we compared that to a U.S. politician propagating Islamist terrorist thought, materials, lies, et cetera, imagine the reaction. And yet sadly, there's still a partisan reaction to this, some denying that the threat is real and that the lie behind the threat is dangerous. CARLSON: American citizens are more dangerous than foreign terrorists. You often hear people say, ""Oh FOX is so extreme. The FOX News is so extreme."" No show on this would ever put that on the air -- ever. And if anyone did, people would resign in protest because that is completely untrue and completely reckless. For once we're not even going to mock Don Lemon for being a mouth breather, though he demonstrably is. The problem is much bigger than that, it's not funny. He and that former Obama official you just saw told their viewers that millions of American citizens are terrorists. Now, that's a lie. For one thing, it is just not true. Press a little and you'll find the Department of Homeland Security which has been upping up the domestic threat for the past week, at great cost to people's sanity. D.H.S. has no actual evidence that Trump voters are planning to hurt anyone, there is no evidence of a plot of any kind, they can see that. Trust us, they would tell you if they found a plot. But the question you have to ask yourself is what kind of effect do lies like that, the ones you just heard are calculated to terrify you? What kind of effect do they have on the country? Especially over time? This is not new. When you tell people they're evil because of how they vote or how they look, and our leaders are definitely telling them that every single day, when you train a population to tally every group of Americans by race and ethnicity, first and foremost, keep track of people's genetic background every time you see a picture. Really? What effect does that have when you promote group identity, even as you intentionally destroy national identity? If you do all of those things, what kind of country do you get at the end? Well, you get a scary divided country, the kind of country where you need steel fencing outside the national legislature. It's very obvious where all of this is going. And it's very, very bad. Part of the solution is to stop talking like this immediately. No more aging spies on cable news declaring war on American citizens, "" ... domestic political enemies more dangerous than al Qaeda."" What? No more power mad Members of Congress dividing people by race so they can conquer. White fragility, white supremacy, white sounds, those are racial attacks, let's stop lying about it. We shouldn't talk that way in public. Those attacks are making people crazy. And by the way, over time, possibly making people dangerous. For real, too threatened, too nuts. Watch this clip and ask yourself what kind of effect this woman is having on the United States right now. REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): There are legitimate white supremacist sympathizers that sit at the heart and at the core of the Republican caucus in the House of Representatives. There's no consequences for racism, no consequences for massaging, no consequences for insurrection, and no consequences means that they condone it. We are now away from acting out of fealty to their President that they had in the Oval Office, and now we are talking about fealty to white supremacist organizations as a political tool. CARLSON: Wait. Let's just be honest, for a second, that woman is a tool of corporate power posing as a truth teller. Look at her campaign contributions. Who is supporting her campaigns? People who want to change the subject away from economics to identity politics. That whole pose is fraudulent in her case. But listen specifically to what she says and think about the effect on the people listening, people standing in airports will hear her say that, quote, ""Fealty to white supremacist organizations as a political tool."" What does that even mean? We're not even sure who she is talking about, apparently, the Republican Party and its Grand Kleagle, Kevin McCarthy of California. That's not true. But it's worse than that. This is a fantasy. It's a very dark fantasy, designed to terrify people and make them easier to command. Over time, probably not long now. It will have other more insidious effects. Talk like that, from our leaders, from our elected officials is going to turn some of our citizens very, very radical. You don't want to live in a country with very, very radical people. So to be clear, whatever you hear about Fox News being radical, we want to live in a country that looks like -- I don't know, 2005, where your race is not the most important thing about you, where you have a chance to get ahead by playing by the rules. That's called moderate. That's called democracy. That's the republic that we want, and talk like this, which is everywhere, all of a sudden, is the enemy of the country we once lived in. Jason Whitlock is a journalist and the truth teller, and we're happy to have him on tonight. Jason, I appreciate your coming on here. Here's my worry. So, you have this weird confluence of events where populism is clearly rising as people decide, hey, the system is actually corrupt. And it disenfranchises me and they're mad. At the very same time, you have the people benefiting from the system, refusing to acknowledge that and instead attacking the people who were mad. I don't -- I'm not sure where that goes, but it really worries me. JASON WHITLOCK, OUTKICK.COM: Tucker, great monologue and my reaction, perhaps a little different than what you expect. But Tucker, I just believe they're using race and identity politics as a distraction from the real agenda, and AOC and others don't believe in the founding principles of this country. They don't believe in the Declaration of Independence. They don't believe in the Constitution. They don't believe in the Emancipation Proclamation. They don't believe in what we accomplished in the Civil Rights Movement, under the leadership of Martin Luther King. They are the insurrectionists. They are the ones trying to take this country, a very dangerous direction. They are distracting everybody with claims of race and racism, while they try to usher in socialism, Marxism and make this country very secular. That is what's going on. Those of us who are believers, those of us who believe in the principles that we were founded upon, and I'm just sorry, if it upsets people, this was founded in Christianity this country was, and that Christianity led to a lot of progress. It ended slavery. It ended Jim Crow. It brought freedom to all Americans and laws that protected all of our freedoms and they are trying to undo all of that and they are distracting us with talks of race, and anybody that is a believer and believes in our founding principles and believes like, America was pretty good when it was Christian-Judeo society, they're trying to silence us, calling white people racist and calling black people that believe in those things Akun or an Uncle Tom, and silence them, and make all those -- all of us that believe in our founding principles, we are the bad guys. Don't listen to them. They're racist. They're sellouts. They don't believe in this new America that we're bringing in, this global society that we're bringing in that's going to make everything better. It's not going to make things better. We're already seeing the evidence. It makes us worse. It has us at each other's throats. It has us at the brink of destabilization. CARLSON: I think that's right. I mean, the difference in vision is really simple. Most religious people, certainly Christians are Universalists. They think that every person is equal before God, because we were all created by God, so we all have equal value. They're selling something very different, in my view, and much darker than that. WHITLOCK: They're selling something very secular. They're creating a godless country. And I'm sorry, and I know Joe Biden is a practicing Catholic. But just based on the actions, based on the people that are being empowered, based on the way they are trying to demonize 75 million Trump supporters and voters the way we're trying to demonize them, it is just unfair, it's inaccurate. Those people have a voice in this country, a well-earned voice in this country. They can't all be reduced to oh, my God, I have impure thoughts. Everybody that has walked this planet except for one person, in my opinion, Jesus Christ has had impure thoughts, has been a sinner. Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, certainly a sinner; Martin Luther King, an idol to me, and icon, certainly a sinner, impure thoughts. I'm just sorry that this little fantasy world where liberals and Democrats are these perfect people, and everybody else is evil, and racist, and a sellout. This is a fantasy land. They are not Jesus Christ. I'm just sorry. And I know they have appointed themselves that and it's driving a lot of people crazy, including me, I've got to be honest with you, I'm so concerned about this country and I'm so concerned about the people that are being silenced. And if those of us that are believers and believe in these founding principles, if we don't put our differences aside and come together, and stand together and stand on the truth that we know, the country is going to fall. CARLSON: I believe that completely. You're a brave man. Jason Whitlock, thank you. So we're kind of trying to keep track to give you some outline of the scope of the crackdown on civil liberties now underway and trying to bring you individuals who suffered under it. Here's one. A literary agent in New York, works for literary agency in the city recently fired not because of what she said online, but because she maintained accounts on Parler and Gab, those are free speech alternatives to corporate social media. The employee's name is Colleen Oefelein and she joins us tonight. Colleen, I appreciate your coming on. So I really wanted to talk to you just to make sure I got this right. You were fired, not because you said something outrageous or immoral online, but because you used specific social media platforms. COLLEEN OEFELEIN, FIRED FOR USING PARLER: Tucker, thank you so much for having me tonight. And thank you for all your hard work. I really think you hit the nail on the head in your monologue. But yes, you are correct. That's what I got fired for. I created a profile on Parler and I created a profile on Gab. I posted the same exact content on Twitter as I posted on those social media platforms and that's what I got fired for. CARLSON: What I'm so struck by here is you work for -- worked for a literary agency, and the basis of course of literature is free thinking. And so you would think that a literary agency would be kind of the last line of defense against this kind of Stalinism, what did your bosses say to you? OEFELEIN: Actually, it was an e-mail -- CARLSON: Of course. OEFELEIN: And pretty succinct that I had created a profile on Parler and Gab and that because of what they called my political activities, they had to take swift action and part ways. CARLSON: Since you worked in the literary world, what do you think the future of literature and art is in a country where people can be fired for using the wrong social media platform? OEFELEIN: It's chilling, Tucker. It's really chilling, because it used to be that being silent was safe on Twitter and in American publishing. But I feel like this signaled to those in American publishing that it's okay to get rid of people who aren't moderate, or who are moderate who aren't publicly left of center. They want people left of center. And so, if you were -- obviously, if you were outwardly conservative, yes, you were vilified. Yes, you were silenced. But being silent used to mean you would be safe from those kinds of actions. Now -- it is, you have to be publicly on the left, otherwise, you're out. CARLSON: It's really a shocking story. I'm going to save this tape. It is a kind of period piece where we emerge from this. I hope it's soon. Good luck, Colleen. Thank you for joining us. OEFELEIN: Thank you, Tucker. CARLSON: If you're wondering why art has died in this country, the whole span from visual arts all the way to comedy, why nothing beautiful is being created right now -- that's why, because nothing grows in an environment like that. Well, throughout the pandemic, the rich got very, very rich, which would be fine, except no one else got rich, everyone else got poorer. That trend seemed to hit a pause just for a moment this week and then infuriated some people. That straight ahead. Plus, enormous foreign snakes are invading the Everglades, a person who hunts pythons is here to explain how many pythons are roaming the Everglades. It's Friday, so we're bringing that to you. Just ahead. CARLSON: Crises have a way of accelerating trends already in progress and this one certainly has. A new analysis shows that billionaires in this country increased their wealth by nearly 40 percent since the coronavirus pandemic came here. That trend was up ended very briefly this week, when an army of amateur day traders on Reddit collectively drove up the stock of GameStop. It's a video game retail that a bunch of hedge funds had shorted. Those hedge funds lost billions, and when they did, many brokerage houses jumped to the rescue by shutting down purchases of GameStop shares. Everyone saw it happen and many were appalled by it. TYLER WINKLEVOSS, AMERICAN INVESTOR: I think this is a much larger issue in the thread of our country, and its fragility in what's happening in the inequality. And frankly, the hypocrisy of the political leaders who say, you can't open your business and run your business and make a living during the pandemic. We won't pass a stimulus bill in time. And oh, by the way, and now you can't trade. You know, what's the next thing they're going to control and say you can't do? CARLSON: One of the Winklevosses, the twins who came up with the idea for Facebook and then left. So what can you do in the face of this? Well, one thing you could do is leave negative reviews for the brokerages that stopped trading, change the rules in the middle of the game. Oh, but you can't because Google is on their side. Google is in this, too. Google removed more than a hundred thousand negative reviews for the brokerage app, Robin Hood would change the rules middle of the game. Oh, so you're allowed to complain says Google. That's not all. If you're a 22-year-old Best Buy employee in Iowa who just made 10 grands by trading GameStop stock, you're a bad person. PETER ATWATER, PRESIDENT, FINANCIAL INSYGHTS: I certainly look at the evolution of this paradigm starting with sort of gamesmanship, people going online and using social media to make money almost as a game, then it became very greed filled. There's a jealousy, there's an anger, there's a frustration at the system. And I think that the size of the crowd now encompasses that aspect. And don't get me wrong, there is always a striving to peaks in the market. But this has got anger behind it and the behavior of the mob, in many ways reminds me of what we saw at the Capitol. CARLSON: Oh, yes, the people on Reddit are greedy. They're insurrectionists. Vivek Ramaswamy is a biotech entrepreneur and author of the forthcoming book ""Woke, Inc.,"" and a very smart man. He joins us now. Vivek, thanks so much for coming on. I'm actually sincerely worried about the way our leaders are handling this. The rest of us learned that, oh, wow. Wall Street is corrupt as every other institution, they're not acknowledging that and they're attacking the people who benefited for like three days from Wall Street for the first time. What's the takeaway from this moment, do you think? VIVEK RAMASWAMY, BIOTECH ENTREPRENEUR: So this is the spotlight, Tucker on the woke industrial complex as we know it. A couple of weeks ago, we saw it with Silicon Valley; Twitter and Facebook taking their users off. Then it's the Google and Apple App Stores, taking entire applications like Parler off their App Stores. I was wondering what are they going to do next? I was actually waiting for them to come after e-mail. I'm sure we're heading on a collision course to censoring hateful or racist e-mails. That's coming soon. CARLSON: Oh, yes. RAMASWAMY: But it turned out, I didn't pick what they were going to do next. Now it's betting stock trades, because Wall Street is getting into the same act as Silicon Valley. But the worst part of it, Tucker, is actually a lot of people lost a lot of money this week. But then they whitewash the whole things with this woke white washing, claiming that it was hate speech. Facebook claiming that it was adult sexual exploitation. And this is getting increasingly farcical that we ought to, as consumers just see through what -- for what it is -- institutional lying at its worst. CARLSON: But you can't keep cracking down like this forever before people go crazy and the system explodes. Don't they understand that? You have to, at some point, admit, okay, I'm wrong, I'm corrupt, or whatever. But you can't just turn it back on the people who expose your corruption, can you forever? RAMASWAMY: No, it's not sustainable. I mean, crony capitalism 1.0, let's go back to the early 2000s. You take a Goldman Sachs CEO and put him in as Treasury Secretary. That's great. That's the vanilla version. But this 2.0 version is actually much more tricky, right, in 2020. CARLSON: Yes. RAMASWAMY: Where crony capitalism 2.0 is, then dress it up with these progressive values. These do-good work smokescreens. And then what they do is you actually trick liberals into adulation. Liberals should be incensed of all, but you trick them into adulation because of their love of woke causes. And meanwhile, you go to the conservatives, and you trick them into submission because they've been taught since 1980 to memorize a line that says the free market can do no wrong, but fail to recognize there's actually not a free market. And so it's actually inherently divisive. Divide and conquer. That's what Corporate America is doing, leaving our democracy in damage in its wake. CARLSON: You're so right. So, you wind up having the Heritage Foundation defending corporations that hate them. It's just so amazing. Triumph -- when the libertarians meet the professional woke people like the rest of us, we are in deep trouble. Vivek, it's great to see you tonight. Thank you for that. It was really smart analysis. RAMASWAMY: Good to see you. CARLSON: So, the World Health Organization is finally getting to the question of where did this coronavirus come from? Their conclusion: they can't really confirm it's from China. They just don't really know. Details straight ahead. CARLSON: Almost immediately after being inaugurated President, Joe Biden did the most important thing he could do, he rejoined the World Health Organization, because they've done a fantastic job with COVID. The W.H.O. for his part is still pretending like China had nothing at all to do with the virus from Wuhan. DR. MICHAEL RYAN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, W.H.O. HEALTH EMERGENCIES PROGRAMME: All hypotheses around the table and it is definitely too early to come to a conclusion of exactly where this virus started either within or without China. CARLSON: That's right, more than a year later, it is still too early -- too early to stop shilling for Communist China which funds the W.H.O. So now, they are looking for another country with an earlier outbreak in a city that has experimental virus labs next to a market where people eat bats. Remarkably, researchers who are not affiliated with the W.H.O. have now determined that the Spanish Flu that killed 50 million people a hundred years ago actually did originate not in Spain, but in China. FOX News medical contributor, Dr. Marc Siegel has been watching all of this and joins us to assess. Good to see you, Doctor. DR. MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR: Tucker, it's our anniversary. About a year ago when you and I were warning the world about an emerging virus, the World Health Organization was calling it a regional problem only and saying it was okay to travel. So now they're being given a second chance, a year later, they're there on the ground finally in China, a place where horseshoe bats in Southern China had emitted a coronavirus 96 percent similar to this and wet markets they have to look at and the Wuhan Institute of Virology, where people were reportedly according to the State Department got sick in the fall of 2019 with COVID-like symptoms. With all of that to examine: bat caves in China, wet markets and the lab itself, they are talking about outside China? This reminds me of history and the person doing it, by the way is a physician, it's not Tedros, it is Dr. Mike Ryan, who is actually a public health expert and in charge of the COVID response. It reminds me of history. About a hundred years ago, as you've said, there was a virus emerging that killed over 50 million people worldwide. No country wanted to take blame for where it came from. We said it's not from our army barracks. France said it's not from us. Spain got blamed for it, of course, but Spain couldn't protest. They didn't have enough power. But then it turned out in 2013, Tucker, Canadian researchers found out that Chinese laborers brought this virus. They were the first to have it. They brought it across the border. Tucker, I'm no Sherlock Holmes, but could history be repeating itself, Tucker? CARLSON: It does seem that way. That's a provocative point, Dr. Siegel. Dr. Marc Siegel joining us tonight, Friday. Great to see you. SIEGEL: Thank you, Tucker. CARLSON: So maybe the lesson is, it's not healthy to have a really, really crowded country. Maybe we should keep that in mind before we crowd ours. Well, it has been three months since Election Day in November and here's something amazing. The race for Congress in New York's 22nd congressional district still has not been decided. Why is New York's election system worse than the election system in say, Honduras or Burkina Faso? Great question. We'll get the latest there, next. Then pythons seem to be taking over parts of South Florida. A python hunter is standing by because it's Friday and we're interested. That's straight ahead. CARLSON: Well, we've got a new President. Who exactly is running the Justice Department? We've got some exclusive reporting on that tonight. In one of his very first acts as President, Joe Biden appointed someone called Nicholas McQuaid to run the D.O.J.'s Criminal Division, the all-important Criminal Division. It turns out that's the same Criminal Division that's currently investigating Biden's son, Hunter. So who is this Nicholas McQuaid exactly? Well, this show can tell you that he has a former business partner of Hunter Biden's new criminal defense attorney, a man called Christopher Clark. Hunter Biden apparently hired Clark in December to help him with the Federal investigation into his business dealings, the criminal investigation that D.O.J. is conducting. Both McQuaid and Clark were law partners together at Latham & Watkins, they worked on the same cases right up until McQuaid took the job at the Department of Justice. On January 21st of this year, the same day, Nicholas McQuaid was featured in a Justice Department press release. Lathan & Watkins filed a motion in court to withdraw McQuaid as an attorney he was working on with Christopher Clark. So that means Joe Biden put as the head of the Criminal Division, the partner of the guy his son had hired to defend him against the Criminal Division. Whoa. We reached out to the Justice Department for comment on this. They refused to say whether McQuaid would recuse himself from matters involving Hunter Biden and his former partner who is representing Hunter Biden. It's all pretty amazing. And another reminder, there's a lot going on within the Biden family. We got another reminder today from POLITICO. They reported this. Joe Biden apparently told his younger brother, Frank, last year during the campaign and we're quoting, ""For Christ's sake, watch yourself. Don't get sucked into something that would first of all hurt you,"" end quote, but by implication would hurt me, too. Too late now. So it's been three months since Election Day, and believe it or not, the race in the 22nd District of New York is still undecided. It's still exceptionally close. Mail-in voting rules led to massive delays there and many other places. Republican Claudia Tenney currently leads that race by 122 votes. She has checked in with us a couple of times since Election Day. She joins us again tonight for an update. Congresswoman, great to see you. What is going on in the 22nd District of New York? CLAUDIA TENNEY (R), NEW YORK CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE: Well, we have a combination of many things. But one thing is for sure, we're really happy to have a more commanding lead than we did before. We went from 29 votes to 122 which is a virtual landslide. But the real problem and we've talked about this before is that so much of what Governor Cuomo did with Executive Orders is adopting the horrible legislation that you've discussed on your show. H.R. 1, the Democrats signature legislation. CARLSON: Yes. TENNEY: They call it The for the People Act, but I think it's for the Democratic takeover of the United States forever act. And this is -- my race highlights exactly why this is so bad and so dangerous to the integrity of our election process and I've lived it for the last almost 90 days, we'll probably have a decision more definitively by Monday which will be the 90-day mark. But this is a disaster. Mail-in voting same day registration, registrations at the Department of Motor Vehicles and now registrations at colleges and universities as if those places are the place where we have to underscore the ability to ensure integrity in our voting system. The blurred lines with these government agencies and making multiple tasks is a huge part of it. But I think a lot of the intent here is the Democrats are interested in both trafficking. They're not interested in integrity, they're interested in getting the votes and getting the win and it is very concerning and it's troubling, and my race is a perfect example of how bad this is really in practice. CARLSON: It's unbelievable. I hope you win for a lot of reasons, but mainly so you can take what you've just learned living under these insane rules to the Congress and save the rest of us from them. I hope you do. Claudia Tenney, thank you. TENNEY: I intend to do that. CARLSON: Amen. TENNEY: Thank you so much, I appreciate it. CARLSON: Thank you. So have you ever eaten pythons? Some have. The python cowboy joins us next to explain. CARLSON: The State of Florida is teeming with refugees from the northeast, fleeing tyranny and mismanagement, but they not the only ones in Florida. Florida is also filled with pythons, big snakes slithering their way through the Everglades and messing with the food chain. So how does the State of Florida plan to restore balance to its very fraught ecosystem? One man has thought a lot about this and he has a really interesting idea. His name is Mike Kimmel. He's a trapper, known in Florida as the Python Cowboy and we're happy to have him on tonight. Mr. Kimmel, thanks so much for coming on. So what is -- what is your plan to deal with the overabundance of pythons in Florida? MIKE KIMMEL, PYTHON COWBOY: Well, it's really not just my plan, you know, a lot of people are involved with it and we need to hunt and we need to remove them. And the state right now has different programs to do that, but we need more help. You know, we need the general public involved. And you know, we're doing everything we can to try to incentivize that. CARLSON: So one of the kind of core ethical precepts of hunting is you eat what you kill? Do you eat python? KIMMEL: Yes, sir. Absolutely. And if I don't need it, I definitely make use of it. You know, you can -- you only need so much snake, so you know anything, I don't eat myself, I feed to my different wildlife rescues and the livestock I have. CARLSON: I mean, it goes without saying it tastes like chicken, so I'm not even going to ask you, but tell me how hard it is to hunt a python and how dangerous? KIMMEL: It's definitely not easy. It's a labor of love. You know, it's something you've got to be passionate about something, you know, to kind of have motivation for. I generally go out there for three to five days at a time. I'm sleeping in the swamp. And I'm hunting these invasive snakes either by boat or in my customized truck or I'm driving these levees that stretch out into the swamp and I'm looking for these snakes while they're hunting for our native wildlife. CARLSON: Well, it looks like they're hunting for you. I'm watching video of blood all over your arm. You got bitten by a python. What was that like? KIMMEL: Yes, you know, sometimes a job gets a little messy, a little dangerous and it's just a part of it. Recently, capturing a big almost 18- foot python, 135 pounds and it struck at me. I was able to dodge it strike, but it gave me another quick half strike. I wasn't expecting it. These older snakes, they are smart. They know what they're doing. And it got me pretty good on my arm. Actually, it got a couple of main veins. I think it just missed an artery, but I had a little bit of a gusher coming out of my arm. CARLSON: Where's that snake now? KIMMEL: Here's the one that got me. But I ended up getting her. CARLSON: That's amazing. What kind of firearm do you use for python hunting? KIMMEL: Generally, I'm just using my hands. I capture them alive. For me, that's the safest way and the most humane way to do it. It's a lot harder to shoot a snake directly in the brain than you think it is. And generally these snakes, they're not scared of anything. They think they're camouflage. You know, they're the top predator and I'm able to sneak up on them, grab them and once I grab them you know they're not going anywhere. It's becomes a wrestling match, but thankfully I get the better of them. CARLSON: Well, it's sporting anyway. No one deer hunts like that though. I would recommend the 308, that's just me. But I am very impressed. Mike Kimmel, it was great to see you tonight. Good luck. Good luck. KIMMEL: Thank you so much. CARLSON: Thank you. We're out of time, amazingly. A lot going on. Still a great country. We'll be back, Monday night, 8:00 p.m., the show that's the sworn enemy of lying pomposity, smugness and groupthink. Have a wonderful weekend with the ones you love. That's the whole point. We will see you soon. Classification"
2021-01-13,"TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. So it looks like they are impeaching Donald Trump again for the second time in four years, a week before he leaves office. With strong bipartisan support, leaders of both parties appear in favor of this. No matter how angry you may be at Donald Trump tonight and many of his voters are angry at him, watching this happen may confuse you. The chaos of an impeachment trial is hardly the peaceful and orderly transition of power both parties assure you they want. So why are they doing this? There has to be a reason and indeed there is one. First, let's be clear about what that reason is not. Legitimate moral outrage will play absolutely no role whatsoever in whatever impeachment proceedings occur, no matter what you hear, no matter how many times Jim Clyburn goes on television and talks about the Civil Rights Movement; no matter how often you see the frail, but determined Nancy Pelosi read lines like this. REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): We know that we face enemies of the Constitution. We know we experienced the insurrection that violated the sanctity of the people's Capitol and attempted to overturn the duly- recorded will of the American people, and we know that the President of the United States incited this insurrection, this armed rebellion against our common country. He must go. He is a clear and present danger to the nation that we all love. CARLSON: Oh, ""the nation we all love,"" of course, yes, that lovable irredeemably immoral nation that must change by force immediately and forever because it is so disgusting and stained by your sin. Yes, they really love it here. It is defended by Donald Trump. Right? Remember that for decades and not that long ago because we recall it vividly, the two most powerful Democrats in the United States Senate were Ted Kennedy and Robert Byrd. Ted Kennedy left a young woman to drown in a drunk driving accident; Robert Byrd was a recruiter for the Ku Klux Klan. Democrats did not seem bothered by any of that. They never said a word. They praised Kennedy and Byrd at every turn including at their funerals, so no, Democrats are not actually outraged in any moral sense by Donald Trump. They never have been. They're too cynical to have feelings that authentic. As if to prove that point, they've named as one of their so-called impeachment managers the young, Eric Swalwell of California who was a sitting Member of Congress who had sex with an actual Chinese spy. So please, ladies, spare us the self-righteous indignation. What's happening here instead is old-fashioned hard-eyed politics. Democrats have every practical reason for wanting to see Trump impeached during his final days in office. The first and most obvious reason is to make Republicans weaker. Every loss diminishes a political party, and impeachment is nothing if not a loss, so there's that. But there's also another thing. Democrats need to keep talking about Donald Trump, next week and forever if they're going to keep their own party together. Most political coalitions are built on shared interests. The Democratic coalition is built on shared genetics. The basic idea is that everyone who is not a straight white man must be united as one in unshakable solidarity. The problem is that can't happen because it's not true. In real life, many Democrats have nothing in common with each other. Once Donald Trump leaves the scene, the great unifier, and it's time to divvy up the spoils of the United States Treasury to begin the great pinata party of 2021. Various components within the Democratic Party, the fabled communities you hear so much about will turn on each other with feral ferocity. You can see glimpses of it now, it's going to be highly ugly. Democrats would like to delay that disaster as long as they can, so they need to keep Donald Trump at the center of the conversation. They are impeaching him so they can continue to give speeches about him. It's that simple. But why are Republicans playing along? They don't really have a sound political rationale for any of this. They are just dumb and guilty. Honestly, that's the reason. Here's how it works: from the perspective of the Republican leadership, it would be best if Donald Trump just went away forever. He is embarrassing. They don't want to talk about him. They'd like him to disappear. So that's their plan with impeachment: make it so that Trump can never run for office again -- not that he actually plans to run for office again -- and then disgrace Trump so thoroughly that he cannot appear in public ever again, then pretend that Donald Trump never happened. Call it the suburban Connecticut denial strategy. Whatever you do, don't talk about mom's alcoholism, just act like it's not happening and maybe it'll go away. Good luck with that. There are a couple of obvious problems with this approach. The first problem is, it won't work. By impeaching the President during his final week in office, Congress will not succeed in discrediting Trump among Republican voters; in fact, it will enhance Donald Trump among Republican voters, obviously. Who does your average Republican voter trust more? Donald Trump or the many people who hate Donald Trump? Donald Trump or Mitch McConnell? Donald Trump or CNN? Come on, you know the answer. It's not complicated. But apparently, it's too complicated for the dummies in the Republican Party who think impeachment will help them in the long run, they are that stupid. Maybe you shouldn't be surprised by that. These are the very same people who still defend the war in Iraq, the ones who will tell you with a straight face that Iran is the single biggest threat we will ever face as a nation. Iran. Not your falling wages or the runaway healthcare costs you can't pay or the financialized hollowed out economy that feels like it's about to collapse, not the Chinese fentanyl that just killed your nephew. No, none of that. Iran? An isolated faraway country you could not find on a map at gunpoint. That's the real threat. The amazing thing is, they mean it when they say it. They are dead serious. That's how stupid and brainwashed they are. And by the way, they are so dumb they assume you agree with them. They have no idea what you really think. They haven't spent five minutes wondering why you voted for Donald Trump in the first place, and by the way, they don't care. The sad thing is, a smart party could do a lot for itself and for the country with a moment like this. A week ago, a violent mob attacked the capitol. Republicans should have no problem opposing that. It ought to be consistent with what they have been saying for decades. Republicans are for law and order. Smash a cop in the face with a fire extinguisher, go to jail. Break windows, hit people with flag poles, the same thing, jail. We are Republicans. We have no tolerance for that kind of crap. This is a civilized country. We won't put up with it. The next time a mob gathers outside the U.S. Capitol Building, and by the way, outside a Wendy's in Minneapolis, or a Federal Building in Seattle or occupies a commercial district in Portland, Oregon by force, Republicans can say, loudly and with a clear and consistent conscience, we are against that. In America, laws are real. They apply to everyone equally. That is the Republican position. It is not hard. But apparently, it is hard. Because for the last week, slow learners like Mitch McConnell have missed it completely. They've allowed themselves instead to be led into rhetorical cul-de-sacs on the question of Donald Trump's personal character as a man. At no point does it seem to have occurred to McConnell or any of these sort of geniuses clustered around him that what is really at stake right now is not the future of Donald Trump. He is elderly and retiring next week, but instead the future of his voters, tens of millions of them, American citizens who in the space of the last seven days have seen themselves redefined as domestic terrorists, that has happened. Republicans in Washington don't seem to have noticed that it happened. Just today, the former MLB pitcher, Curt Schilling announced that he has had his personal insurance policies cancelled by his insurer. Why? Because Curt Schilling wrote a social media post defending Donald Trump, and in 2021, that's not allowed. You could lose your insurance for that. You could also lose your bank account, your website, your access to e-mail and social media, your ability to communicate with the outside world and there's nothing you can do about it because you can also lose your lawyer. No legal representation for. You how long before they cut off your water and electricity? Before UPS won't deliver your packages, and not to wreck your day, but guess what? Amazon is now one of America's biggest grocery providers. Good thing you don't need to eat. But no problem says Mitch McConnell, the real problem is Donald Trump and once he is gone, everything will be fine. Ned Ryun is CEO of American Majority, author of the book, ""Restoring our Republic"" and he joins us tonight. Ned Ryun, great to see you. NED RYUN, FOUNDER AND CEO, AMERICAN MAJORITY: Good to be with you. CARLSON: I think a lot of Republicans on the Hill and other places and I'm among them, really bothered by Trump's reckless behavior last week and horrified by what the mob did to the Capitol. Impeachment, however, is designed to send another message. Tell us what you think it is. RYUN: Well, I would first point out that neither of the two impeachments had anything to do with facts, it's about power and who wields it, and it is retribution. I mean, it really is setting the bar and a warning to any outsider who dares to challenge the status quo, the administrative state, this broken system of the administrative state and the ruling class and dares to actually stand up and say, hey, maybe this system isn't working for the American worker and American taxpayer, and the amazing part about some of this, too, is what a middle finger this was to the American working class and the American taxpayer. The one guy who has clearly stood up in the last four years and said I'm actually going to champion your cause, right, this is about -- supposed to be about the American people, of, by and for the people. I'm going to champion your cause. The ruling class, the establishment decides to go out and impeach him twice in 13 months, and the amazing part in all of this is you're talking about Curt Schilling getting his insurance taken away, there's all this talk of unity, right? There's the unified -- we're going to unify -- Democrats, their definition of unity is you will submit, you will conform, and you will conform to our radical ideology. There is no dissent and in fact, now, Tucker, dissent is terrorism. That's where we're at. We're not going towards unity and healing because that's not what they are aiming for. CARLSON: But why is it so hard for Republicans on the Hill who have been locked in this bizarre sadomasochistic relationship with Trump for four years, to say what's true for a lot of people. Look, you know, Trump complicated lots of views. I don't really care. He is leaving next week. What I care about are his voters. I care about the country, the people who voted for him for a reason that probably has nothing to do with him, but had to do with the mismanagement of the country by the people in charge of it. Where is their defender? Sincerely. RYUN: Well, first of all, I think people like Liz Cheney and Mitch McConnell have overdosed on stupid pills. I think they've been overly influenced by the failed neocon ideology especially with Liz Cheney. I think they are influenced by a donor class that loathes and despises Trump and quite frankly, views the Trump voters with great disdain. There's no way that the Republican Party can be a strong party, a winning party, moving forward without the Trump base and to do what they are doing today, not defending but even more so alienating by dismissing them and not challenging this rhetoric that they are domestic terrorists. I think the Republican Party is going to find themselves in a very problematic place if they don't figure this out and figure it out very soon. I will say this, Tucker, for the 10 Republicans that went out and voted to impeach Trump, thank you for self-identifying and wanting to have primary challenges in 2022 because that's what you're going to get. CARLSON: Yes. Stop talking about Trump, start talking about his voters in the country. That's my view. Ned Ryun, I appreciate your coming on tonight. RYUN: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: So as we told you, impeachment is underway, Nancy Pelosi has named nine Impeachment Managers for today's hearings and according to ""The New York Times"" that's a major win for equity. That's because as Pelosi announced in a press release, seven of those nine Impeachment Managers have the right immutable qualities. They are quote, ""People of color, LGBTQ or women."" So scientifically speaking, this impeachment was a lot less bigoted than the last one which really was an exercise in racism and exclusion. We didn't know that. But there was some white privilege, we have to tell you, among those Impeachment Managers, and the embodiment of that privilege was a man called Eric Swalwell. He was chosen by Nancy Pelosi for a bigger reason than his sex or race. More than any other Democrat, Eric Swalwell is an expert on threats to democracy. He doesn't sleep on National Security threats, he sleeps with them. It's for the greater good. Today, Eric Swalwell showed his wild intelligence oats once more and here's what we found. REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA): Osama bin Laden did not enter U.S. soil on September 11, but it was widely acknowledged that he was responsible for inspiring the attack on our country and the President with his words, using the words fight with the speakers that he assembled that day who called for trial by combat and said we have to take names and kick ass. I'm comparing the words of an individual who would incite and radicalize somebody as Osama bin Laden did to what President Trump did. CARLSON: Even in the midst of darkness, there is light. For us that means Mark Steyn, best-selling author, in-house man of mystery and professional assessor of the career and sex life of Congressman Eric Swalwell. Great to see you, Mark Steyn. What is this? MARK STEYN, AUTHOR AND COLUMNIST: Yes, well, I think Nancy Pelosi is just sticking it to us because she can. CARLSON: That's so sick. STEYN: You know, we -- there's any number of hack mediocrities who could have taken the place of Swalwell among the House Impeachment Managers, but she is just deciding to twist the knife. This guy, as you said, has been penetrated thoroughly by Chinese Intelligence. It is about the only Intelligence he has been penetrated by and he is actually an asset in a certain sense of the Chinese Communist Party. His paramour, Fang Fang, the Mata Hari of the California Democratic Party planted an intern in his office. I love that 007 picture of him in his tuxedo and Fang Fang saying the names, Fang Fang Fang. I love -- I love that. But the fact is, he embodies the complete fraudulence and dysfunction of the American system. As you know, you played that clip a couple of weeks back where he is on one of these hearings and that's one thing I'm giving up for the New Year, by the way, my resolution is to quit following these pointless hearings. He is quizzing Comey about the ways you can be compromised and he is saying, one of the ways you can be compromised is by a honey trap. At that point, he knows he has been compromised by a honey trap because the dirty, stinking, rotten and corrupt F.B.I. tipped him off about it so he could get his paramour out of the country, and the head of the F.B.I. is the guy he is quizzing, James Comey and James Comey should have said, yes, yes, I know all about being compromised by honey traps. We tipped you off about that, Eric. And instead, they didn't. They engaged in this pathetic dinner theater version of a congressional hearing and it is all bad dinner theater. We've got some third-rate summer stock 007 pretending to be undercover, quizzing this dirty corrupt head of the big powerful agency, James Comey. They both know the reality that the only one who has been compromised by a honey trap isn't Trump, but him, and yet they know their lines and they're going through this acting thing. It's all pointless. It's all completely pointless, fraudulent, and dysfunctional. It's a perversion of a self-governing democratic society. CARLSON: Designed to humiliate us, that's of course always the point. STEYN: Absolutely. CARLSON: I just have to wonder, though, so Pelosi comes out and says every one of the Impeachment Managers is diverse, not noting that women are the majority actually in our country, but whatever, we'll just play along with the ruse for a second. Is sleeping with a Chinese spy now a diversity quality? Do you get to wear a diversity badge once you've had sex with a Chinese spy? Are you now in this diversity club? STEYN: Yes. I think actually, having been compromised by a foreign enemy is actually -- it's actually genuinely diverse. If you ask me, if I'm interested -- CARLSON: Good point. STEYN: Am I interested in the number of Muslim trans-genders among the Impeachment Managers? No. But I am actually interested if it's now sufficiently diverse that it includes compromised Representatives who are playing for the other team? And I think when you have a guy who has been compromised by Chinese Intel, I think that's great. Chairman Xi has got a House Impeachment Manager. Maybe we should like -- let the Supreme Ayatollah in Iran have a House Impeachment Manager. I would -- I think ISIS might like a House Impeachment Manager and so might Putin. Let's celebrate diversity in a genuine sense as Eric Swalwell, the Chinese politburo's man on the impeachment management team does. CARLSON: But sadly, we've got to report to our viewers tonight that all of the entities you just mentioned are as of tonight being excluded by the exclusionary policies of the House Impeachment Manager team. STEYN: Absolutely, terrible. CARLSON: Mark Steyn, great to see you. STEYN: Thanks a lot, Tucker. CARLSON: So we told you earlier this week about a top Joe Biden appointee called Kristen Clarke. Very soon, she could be running the Civil Rights Division at the Justice Department, one of the most powerful law enforcement entities in the United States, in the world really. Kristen Clarke believes that melanin makes people who possess it superior to those who don't. There's a new effort to silence that story. It is so over the top no one will talk about it. We will tell you what they don't want you to see, straight ahead. CARLSON: Earlier this week, we brought you exclusive reporting on a woman called Kristen Clarke. She is about to become a significant figure in this country. She is Joe Biden's pick to head the D.O.J.'s Civil Rights Division. Back while she was at Harvard, as we reported the other night, Clarke wrote that black people might have quote, ""superior physical and mental abilities, as well as greater spiritual powers"" because of a chemical called melanin. That's lunatic. Wikipedia, the most popular encyclopedia on the internet and in the world locked Kristen Clarke's entry after our segment, after our fresh reporting and that prevented anyone who might have added references to her lunacy to her entry on Wikipedia. That's corrupt. Other media organizations, of course, have completely ignored the story. Just to be clear, this isn't simply about what Kristen Clarke said while she was at Harvard. Two years ago, she came on this show to reaffirm her belief that the inequalities a person possesses: skin color and gender are more important than what that person does, the skills that person has, which is an insane perspective. Ten years ago, no one would say that out loud. She happily did. Watch. CARLSON: Do you think that airlines should apply the same diversity rules you're calling for here that they shouldn't take the people who score the highest on the pilot tests, but that they should hire also on appearance? The way people look? KRISTEN CLARKE, BIDEN NOMINEE FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE CIVIL RIGHTS DIVISION: Every workplace, whether you're talking about airlines -- CARLSON: So pilots to heart surgeons, too? CLARKE: Federal agencies should hire the best, but should place a premium on diversity and Secretary Zinke's -- CARLSON: But which is more important? The way that you look or what you do? What you're capable of doing? So like when you're flying a plane, how important is it what you look like? Your appearance? CLARKE: Incredibly important and it's also important -- CARLSON: Appearance is important. CLARKE: And it is also important that we place a premium on diversity and the fact that we have people in this administration -- CARLSON: But diversity means appearance. It means what you look. CLARKE: No, no, no. CARLSON: You're talking about the shallowest possible criterion. CARLSON: It is quote, ""incredibly important"" what your airline pilots and your heart surgeons look like. That is lunacy, just to be clear. It makes no difference what they look like, what matters is what they do and that's all that matters. It goes without saying that Kristen Clarke also supports excluding children from college admissions because of their skin color, so of course she will likely drop the D.O.J.'s lawsuit against Yale for race discrimination, which they've long engaged in. Ward Connerly is the honorary President of Californians for Equal Rights. He has dedicated his life to opposing racial discrimination and we're honored to have him on tonight. Mr. Connerly, thanks so much for coming on. WARD CONNERLY, HONORARY PRESIDENT, CALIFORNIANS FOR EQUAL RIGHTS: My pleasure. CARLSON: The idea that someone would say out loud, would articulate the crudest kind of crackpot race theory like melanin make give some people spiritual powers and then have that information buried by the news media, I mean, it is an Orwell moment. CONNERLY: Well it's a scary moment. We have just gone through a campaign in California that addresses this whole issue of ""race"" in quotes and how it's to be applied or not applied in public life and the thing that I've come away from that campaign fearful of, Tucker, is the abuse of language that we saw and that we will see from people such as Miss Clarke who will tell you that they want equality. They don't tell you however that they're redefining the word equality. They want equity, which sounds so seductive, sounds like equality. It is not equality. It is using the government to distribute benefits on the basis of what they believe each group deserves. And my fear is that we're going down a path from which we may not be able to recover as a country. CARLSON: Yes, I agree with that. CONNERLY: There was a time when I think that the President-elect could withstand this torrent of idiocy that I see coming at us, but I don't think that he is capable of doing that now. I think that he is surrounded by forces that can overwhelm him and these news people who are bright, great degrees, Harvard and the like, are going to throw more BS at our society than we will be able to consume. CARLSON: How can you have a pluralistic society, a society in which there's no majority of any group, of any ethnic group and a system where certain groups get rewards and others don't? I mean isn't that just a recipe for something just awful? I mean, how does that work? CONNERLY: Well, I think we're beginning to see in my Great State of California how that works and that is proportional representation: Proposition 16, which is what we defeated in this state and you were good enough to give us the visibility to expose that. Proposition 16 at the heart of it is that each group is entitled to whatever their numbers are in the population. CARLSON: Man, that is just -- that whole way of thinking is poison and it's a recipe for disunion, not just disunity, disunion. We should stop. Ward Connerly, I appreciate all your efforts to get us to stop and thanks for coming on tonight. CONNERLY: Thank you. CARLSON: So a lot of people, maybe most people who voted for Joe Biden did because they wanted calm and peace and just make the noise stop. They're getting something very different. Joe Biden is making a major push to change this country permanently and immediately, right out of the gate. We'll tell you what he is doing, straight ahead. CARLSON: Well, if you've listened to Democrats lately, you've been pretty certain that white supremacists are the single biggest problem that we face in this nation. In fact, that group even managed to lead something called an insurrection against the Capitol last week. Some of those white supremacists aren't even white it turns out. They are in disguise and that's how big this problem is. What's interesting is that given that this country apparently is overrun with crazed bigots, you might think that Democrats would want to keep immigrants from other countries far away just for their own protection. That seems logical and of course, if Democrats believed what they were saying about white supremacy that would be their position, but it's the opposite. Instead of doing everything they can to encourage more people to come here as quickly as possible because illegal immigration isn't dangerous, some laws are not worth upholding, it turns out. Joe Biden told us last year it was inspiring. JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: Guess what? They're the reason why. The legal as well as undocumented are the reason why our society is functioning, the reason why our economy is growing. We don't talk about that. We stand up and act like it's a burden. It is not a burden, it's a gift. CARLSON: Oh, it is a gift. Illegal immigration is a gift. Breaking law is a gift like childbirth is a gift. In fact, it's better than that. When minors from Guatemala stream across the border either alone or packed together in the back of a smuggler's truck, this country experiences something beautiful. I mean, they suffer, but we benefit. Yes. It's a good thing. And again, these are the same people with a straight face who are telling you right now that the law is sacrosanct and anyone who breaks it should be punished. But that's the kind of law breaking that they're completely for. Now keep in mind, according to Joe Biden, that their presence here is enriching to all of us and anyone who says otherwise is clearly a bigot. So suddenly, all those unhappy single women whose big life achievement was majoring in British Literature at Georgetown really aren't single anymore. They have children. What's more beautiful than that? You're not supposed to notice it right now. There was that insurrection after all, but Joe Biden wants you to know you should be happy of it. Thousands of new people here, 330 million people in the country now, we can get to 400 million. No debate, you should be happy. Biden is doing everything he can to make that happen. The first hundred days of my administration, no one, he said, no one will be deported at all. He promised that last March in a debate, and no one means no one. Murderers, rapists, they can stay, too. After a hundred days, Joe Biden says he will deport felons and what is a felon, you might ask? That question turns a lot. According to Joe Biden, not all felons qualify as felons. BIDEN: You only arrest for the purpose of dealing with a felony that's committed and I don't count drunk driving as a felony. CARLSON: Oh so drunk driving is totally fine. Now, you were raised to think drunk driving was terrible and you go to jail if you did it because other people die in drunk driving accidents, but when people from other countries who are here illegally get busted for drunk driving, that's wrong. That's not a big deal, so stop being so uptight about other people's drunk driving. Business owners by the way, no drunk driving for them. They'll go to jail for defying the lockdowns. Meanwhile, House Democrats pass legislation retroactively to award stimulus payments to people here illegally. Joe Biden is likely to sign similar legislation into law. So as you're waiting for your $1,200.00 check or watching your business die or going broke or knowing with dead certainty that your kids will never live as well as you do, he is giving money to people who have no right to be here in the first place and that's just the first step. After that, citizenship to millions of people who are already here. So what effect will that have on millions of Americans who are already displaced in their own country? People who can't find jobs and who are worried about the future. According to Joe Biden, those people aren't really American at all. Last January, he said that out loud. If you don't go to school and do well, then you are less American than the migrants streaming across the border. Watch. BIDEN: These kids have come. They've done well. Most of these kids who are over -- there's a lot of them and they're not just Hispanic or Asian Pacific Islanders as well and they in fact have done very, very well. In many cases, they are more American than most Americans are because they have done well in school, they believe the basic principles that we all share. CARLSON: That's really dark. They are more American than most Americans are. Right? No we're more American because we're citizens and they're breaking our laws, but not Joe Biden, they are more Americans than most Americans are because they've done well in school. It'll be hard to find a more succinct summation of how the modern Democratic Party thinks or how it sees you. If you don't have a four-year degree from Wesleyan, you're the real illegal immigrant. Meanwhile, Biden's proposals are already causing a surge of illegal immigration. Data shows illegal border crossings rose after the November election, not surprisingly, people aren't stupid. The Border Patrol encountered nearly double the number of illegal immigrants in December as they did the year before. We've seen that before. The summer of 2014, Central American migrants were flooding into Texas. In response to that, the Obama administration did not close the border, instead the State Department started an advertising blitz in Central America. Advertisements vowed that anyone trying to cross the border without documents would face quote, ""immediate deportation."" That was a lie and because it was a lie, it didn't work. People in Central America again are not stupid. They have every incentive to come here. Many are great people by the way, not attacking them personally, attacking the people who make our laws knowing they will be violated. Everyone in Central America knew they could bring their family members with them or make frivolous asylum claims and walk across the border. It was common knowledge. Even the most skilled liars in the United States government, even Barack Obama couldn't convince them otherwise. Joe Biden wants to pretend that never happened. ""Trust me,"" he told migrants and immigration activists last month, but they don't have any reason to do that. Now, Joe Biden is simultaneously claiming that America is overrun with Nazis and that immigrants should move here as quickly as possible. It doesn't even make sense, or maybe it does make a kind of dark sense. In a matter of weeks, Americans, the people Joe Biden thinks are the real illegal aliens in their own country will suffer the consequences of these policies, so everyone who voted for Joe Biden thinking, oh, a return to the status quo. No. Welcome to real change. Well, the rules on social media are changing very fast, what exactly does it take to get banned permanently from the internet? We look at that question in some detail straight ahead. CARLSON: Well, after a hundred years of championing the First Amendment, Democrats are now telling you that censorship is absolutely necessary to protect you and their donors in Big Tech are happy to oblige. There's a lot of violent rhetoric they're not censoring though and that's kind of weird. David Marcus of ""The Federalist"" works out of New York, has an amazing piece today in ""The New York Post"" describing all the things they're not censoring and it makes you wonder why. David Marcus joins us tonight to explain. David, thanks so much for coming on. So what did you find? DAVID MARCUS, ""THE FEDERALIST"": Well, Twitter claims that it has to censor conservative voices and ban President Trump because they are in violation of their safety guidelines, so I did about a 10-minute search of Twitter's own platform and found hashtags like #KillTrump, #AssassinateTrump. I found a user whose current name is Pigs in a Blanket fry Them Like Bacon, a reference to killing police. I found examples of Antifa using the platform to help organize their riots. So, this only has to do with Twitter trying to silence its critics and protect its interests. Twitter doesn't care about the safety of the American people. The full comprehensive list of things that Twitter cares about are its money and its power. CARLSON: What's so funny though is this has been such a successful tactic in pushing professional conservatives, the ones who are supposed to be defending us, back on their heels. You know, you can't believe what's on Parler. It's a cesspool of violence and filth, and they're like oh, yes, I'm not going to defend that. Nobody says what you're saying which is please, it's the internet. There's a lot of garbage out there. It doesn't mean you should censor people. MARCUS: Absolutely, and the monopolistic banning of Parler is really troublesome. This is so much worse than any monopoly that we've seen before. I mean, railroad barons and Ma Bell didn't have a dark dystopian vision of the future in which people were locked in their houses staring at screens while machines went burr and brought them everything that they needed. And if that sounds familiar, it's because we just had a dress rehearsal of it and what the Big Tech oligarchs learned is that a frightening number of the American people will simply sit down and take it and why? Well, because of safety. CARLSON: Well and also, they're anesthetized with soma. You know weed and Netflix, so it's like -- it's totally fine like I am comfy. You know, let it happen. But I have to say, it's hard -- and I'm not a conspiracist in any way, but we just have had like nine months of lockdowns that have made people increasingly dependent on digital technology companies and then it turns out, they can withhold the love if they want. I mean, maybe there's no connection, but it's kind of amazing, isn't it? MARCUS: Oh, there's absolutely a connection. I mean, when Twitter spent months and months banning legitimate science that argued against lockdowns and now suddenly, my brilliant Governor Andrew Cuomo has had this amazing revelation that oh, maybe lockdowns hurt people. You know, there's clearly a connection. I mean, there's a connection to them burying ""The New York Post"" Hunter Biden story to undermine an election. All of these decisions operate again in their own interest and my message to Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey is that, he may be a billionaire and he may be frolicking on yachts with Beyonce and Jay-Z, I'm just a journalist but there's millions of Americans like me who are not going to sit back and just take this. CARLSON: That's totally right and you know, I have to say, I hate to judge people's parenting. It's very hard to be a parent, hard to take your kids to a restaurant, but the next time I see parents with little kids staring at an iPad in a restaurant, you know, if you walk by and a kid was like tugging on a Winston, you'd say, yes, you're probably a little young to be smoking, right? But kids let their -- I mean, kids are allowed by their parents to get completely addicted to this garbage, this poison and nobody says anything. MARCUS: Absolutely. CARLSON: Sorry, I lost control. Dave Marcus, great to see you tonight, thank you for your sober analysis and your reporting. The President of the United States in his final week in office impeached by the House of Representatives today. Major developments of course all over Washington particularly in the Senate. Will they hold a trial? That's straight ahead. DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: These are tense and difficult times. The efforts to censor, cancel and blacklist our fellow citizens are wrong and they are dangerous. What is needed now is for us to listen to one another, not to silence one another. All of us can choose by our actions to rise above the rancor and find common ground and shared purpose. We must focus on advancing the interests of the whole nation. CARLSON: That was the President today during today's hearings. Jim Clyburn, a Democrat from South Carolina explain the reasoning for the second impeachment. This is about the keeping the President from ever winning a democratic election again, no matter what voters might want. REP. JIM CLYBURN (D-SC): If we do not hold him accountable and remove him from power, a future attempt could very well be successful. This President must be impeached and convicted and he must be prevented from ever attempting to seize power again. CARLSON: Seize power in an election. To save democracy, we must end it. A little creepy, not the creepiest thing Democrats did today. That honor goes, as it often does to Kamala Harris. Pay attention to her socks. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Auntie, Auntie. I got you a gift. Impeach mints. CARLSON: So much craziness, one shining star of reason, Victor Davis Hanson of the Hoover Institution joins us to sum up the day. Professor, thanks for coming on. What do you think? VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION: Thank you. Well, there's so many things to think about. I am reminded of the biblical warning, ""He without sin can cast the first stone,"" but I mean here we have Nancy Pelosi that tore up the State of the Union address on national television. We had Chuck Schumer who was weighing in the future Senate Majority Leader in March, remember, Tucker, he went out in front of the Supreme Court while it was in session and said, ""Gorsuch, Kavanaugh,"" you're going to reap the whirlwind -- you're not you're not going to know what hit you. You're going to pay a price. That was pretty inciteful. We've had Kamala Harris with a Minnesota Bail Fund where she urged donation to bail out people who had been convicted of street violence, and Joe Biden said that he'd like to take the President of the United States behind the gym and beat him up. So these people don't have any leg to stand on. Everybody has criticized Donald Trump rightly, but I don't think these people -- these are sinners themselves. They should ask for remorse not to indict somebody else. Then we have the idea of what was the purpose of impeachment? According to the founders and when we read ""The Federalist"" papers, it was supposed to be a rare rebuke of a President who committed a high crime and misdemeanor and we didn't do it in the 20th Century in the second, we only did it in the second term. We threatened Nixon in the second term. We did it with Bill Clinton because they were -- you couldn't get them out of office. They had already been re-elected. Donald Trump, this is actually the third time. The first time, we had 58 votes to try to impeach him in December of his first year on Russian collusion and then we had the second impeachment, the second successful impeachment of him and for some reason they thought you know Donald Trump was crazy because he had a suspicion that Biden Incorporated might have had undue influence with Ukraine. And then we had the third one, this one, and we don't really have specific charges, but it's exactly what the founders didn't want. So we've destroyed these institutions that protect Presidents in times of, you know, political acrimony and we did it with the special counsel, we destroyed the sanctity of that office and we've done it with the 25th Amendment. We've used it so promiscuously that threat. So now, Joe Biden is going to be President, Tucker, and sure as we're speaking here, there will probably be a correction as there always is in a midterm election. Are the Republicans going to come in and say, you know, Joe Biden, he said something the other day. He is not cognitively aware, let's use the 25th Amendment. Or you know what? Joe Biden did not enforce immigration law. He is sworn to execute the laws of the United States. Let's impeach him. Or you know what? We better get a special counsel to look at the Ukraine matter again. So that's what they've done, and why did they do this? Because we're going to see in two weeks tucker the most comprehensive effort to change the way we govern in this state whether it's a mission of states, dismissal of the whole idea of Electoral College, pack the court and that's what it's about. They are disarming or preempting that fight by disarming their opposition. CARLSON: You see it clearly. I wish our elected leaders did. Victor Davis Hanson, great to see you. Thank you. And with that, Sean Hannity. Classification"
2021-02-25,"TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. Springfield, Massachusetts just above Hartford is one of the toughest cities in the United States, but it was not always that way. Basketball was invented in a gym in Springfield in 1891, so was the first gasoline powered engine, amazingly. Indian motorcycles were once made there. But as manufacturing died, so did the city and it devolve into a sadly familiar kind of American landscape: drugs, violence, waves of impoverished immigrants. Just yesterday, a man was shot to death on Main Street. Springfield is a tragic place, but it's also a living metaphor. Less than 20 miles away is another town, also a metaphor. It's called North Hampton, Massachusetts. It's as well kept as Springfield is fraying. North Hampton doesn't have manufacturing, it's got something better than that. It has a college called Smith. Smith is an all-female Liberal Arts school. It used to be impressive years ago. Now, it's definitely not, but that's not the point. The point is, Smith is rich. That's why North Hampton is pretty, and Springfield is not. Smith has an endowment of almost $2 billion. Tuition there for a single year is more than $75,000.00 per year. So here's the question and it's relevant now. Who has more privilege? The people of Springfield or the women of Smith College? You think that'd be an easy question. One place is famous for burned out buildings and murders, the other has wrought iron gates and its nationally known Art Museum on campus. So Smith has more privilege, correct? No, not correct. The ladies of Smith are oppressed. They are victims, and do you know who is oppressing them? The kind of people who live in Springfield. Now, we learned all of this recently from a Smith student called Oumou Kanoute. Kanoute is an exotic name, but she has a resume that can only come from the most established kind of background. Kanoute is from New York. She went to boarding school in Connecticut at a place called Westminster. Then she headed to Smith. The school she attended charge more than the average American makes in a year. That sounds like the definition of privilege, doesn't it? But not so fast. Watch this tape from July 31, 2018. This is the moment that Oumou Kanoute found out that she was oppressed. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hi. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How are you doing? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Good, how are you? TEXT: So, I'm sitting down minding my damn business and someone calls the cops on me while I'm just chilling. This is why being black in America is scary. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We were wondering why you were here? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh, I was eating lunch. I'm working the summer program. So just relaxing on the couch? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, you have sitting breaks now? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're in one -- with one of the summer programs. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, I'm actually a TA. Okay. TEXT: Now, he is apologizing on behalf on the racist punk who called the police on me for absolutely nothing. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So that's what it was. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: All right. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He just said, from the doorway, he didn't know who it was. He watches over Western probably. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, I -- it's okay. It's just like, kind of stuff like this happens way too often, where people just feel like threatened. CARLSON: So that's not a very interesting piece of tape, actually. Everyone is polite. It seems like some kind of misunderstanding, nothing really happened. But later that night, Kanoute posted a message to Facebook assessing what had happened. What you just saw, she said was proof of vicious racial discrimination. Quote, ""All I did was be black. It's outrageous that some people questioned my being at Smith College and my existence overall as a woman of color."" End quote. Kanoute claimed that what you just saw was a racial attack, not just against her, but against all people who look like her. Then she accused a cafeteria worker, a woman called Jackie Blair of being a racist even though Blair was not involved in the episode. Now, that story didn't make sense. None of it did. And yet institution after institution took her side over the side of an hourly worker and they did so immediately. The ACLU claimed that Kanoute had been singled out for quote, ""eating while black."" The media came to the same conclusion. A few days after that tape was shot, Kanoute appeared on ""Good Morning, America"" on ABC to explain that she doesn't feel safe at Smith anymore, even in its art gallery or botanical garden. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This young lady calls the entire situation outrageous and she is sharing her story so that no other woman of color goes through what she went through. OUMOU KANOUTE, ALLEGES TO HAVE BEEN RACIALLY PROFILED: I am just so upset. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is Oumou Kanoute. She is a sophomore at the college working as a teacher's assistant and residential adviser over the summer. She was confronted by campus police officers. KANOUTE: I see the cop walk in with a Smith employee whom I've never seen before. And the man asked me, we were wondering why you're here. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Kanoute still emotional over it all says she was very nervous and overwhelmed after the incident. KANOUTE: It just still upsets me to just talk about it because I don't even feel safe on my own campus and I'm away from home. I'm the first in my family to go to college. CARLSON: Well, in response to this, the President of Smith College, Kathleen McCartney did not wait for an investigation to find out exactly what had happened. No, she moved against the person who made less immediately. She suspended the janitor the first day. Then she launched white accountability seminars to immediately reeducate and browbeat all white employees at Smith. But even as she singled out her colleagues on the basis of their skin color, McCartney declared a statement that singling people out because of their skin color is wrong. And then she concluded with no evidence whatsoever that that is exactly what you saw in that tape, quote: ""This painful incident reminds us of the ongoing legacy of racism and bias in which people of color are targeted, while simply going about the business of their ordinary lives."" But it didn't stop there. What happened next is documented at length in a recent piece in ""The New York Times,"" here's a short version. Jackie Blair and the other employees who were falsely accused of racism by the school had their lives completely upended. Kanoute posted Blair's name, her photograph, her e-mail address on social media and then called her a quote, ""racist."" Kanoute also published the name and photograph of a janitor who was not even involved in the episode. Then people showed up at Blair's home threatening her, putting threatening letters in her mailbox. In the end, the investigation found no evidence of racism in this incident. But Smith effectively ignored the investigation and its results. Kathleen McCartney, the President of school announced, quote: ""It is impossible to rule out the potential role of implicit racial bias."" In other words, the janitor, the cafeteria worker, the security guard can't prove they're not racist. They probably are, implicitly. Meanwhile, Kathleen McCartney issued no public apology of any kind to the employees she had just slandered or suspended. Neither did Kanoute or the ACLU apologize. They claim the workers targeted Kanoute for her skin color, and they kept claiming that. Consider this remarkable statement from a man called Rahsaan Hall. He is both the Racial Justice Director for the ACLU of Massachusetts, and Kanoute's lawyer, quote"" ""It's troubling that people are more offended by being called racist than by the actual racism in our society. Allegations of being racist, even getting direct mailers in their mailbox is not on par with the consequences of actual racism."" In other words, if you're falsely accused of racism and you don't like it, that's evidence you're a racist, especially if you're a janitor. You could not find a more perfect distillation of the moment we're living through right now. Here we have in Kanoute, one of the most privileged people on Planet Earth, telling us that she's being oppressed by her servants. And yet, rather than getting laughed out of the room, or sent for a psych evaluation, all the other privileged people not in vigorous agreement with her and start punishing the staff. We're going to look back at moments like this one in shame. The question is, why didn't anyone speak up while it was happening? At Smith, at least one woman did. Her name is Jodi Shaw. She went to Smith. She worked there as a librarian. She loved the school. Smith planned to stay, but when woke politics became a racial caste system, a system which students and teachers were favored or punished because of the way they look, she opted out. In November, she came on this show. JODI SHAW, LIBRARIAN: Well, my story really begins with July 31, 2018 when a black student accused a white staff member of racially motivated behavior, and the college conducted a very thorough investigation of this incident and concluded that there was no evidence of racial bias. But from the day this accusation was leveled and moving forward, the college did everything in its power to support this narrative that something horribly racist had happened on that day. And not only that, that racism is a very widespread and pervasive problem on the campus. CARLSON: Jodi Shaw has left Smith. Tracey Putnam Culver worked at Smith for quite some time. She has also left. We're happy to have her on tonight. Tracey, We're grateful to have you tonight. You spent many years working at Smith. Were you surprised to see wage earners, people at the lowest end of the wage scale at Smith denounced as racists by a student, privileged by definition and her word be taken as truth before the investigation even concluded? What did you make of that as you watched it? TRACEY PUTNAM CULVER, FORMER SMITH COLLEGE STAFFER: I thought it was irrational. I didn't understand why there wasn't a meeting held at the very most with the staffers that were accused with the college and with the student and everything could have been straightened out immediately. I don't -- I still to this day do not understand why the President and Amy Hunter from the Office of Equity and Inclusion decided to immediately assume guilt on the side of staff. CARLSON: Yes. What's so distressing about this story is that it seems like the people accused were really hurt by it. Tell us about them since you worked there. CULVER: Oh gosh, well, I've worked there. I worked there for 35 years, and the staff member that was accused of making the phone call had been there for over 30 years and was a residential custodian who saw the students every day. And McCartney seemed to assume that the reason he said Oumou was out of place was because she was black. But in actuality, it was because she was somewhere, she shouldn't have been. She was in a closed house. He was put on administrative leave for three months, mandatory leave. The dining assistant who wasn't even involved in the incident whose face appeared on Facebook with Oumou's posting, she still hasn't recovered. She has an autoimmune disease that's exacerbated by stress. She ended up in the hospital. The campus policeman who essentially was the poster boy for his department for 30 years, he was fired in 2019 for an undisclosed reason that was both supposedly not connected. And the other custodian that was misidentified was so traumatized by threats that he never came back to Smith. So it's been a really hard road for those folks, and it still amazes me that the college allowed a 19-year- old to wreak havoc on their lives. CARLSON: Well, the whole story is stunning. And what about the young woman who did wreak that havoc, the person of privilege who hurt the custodian, and the campus police officer? What happened to her? Was she punished in any way that you know of by the school for making a false allegation? CULVER: Of course not. No, she wasn't. She was apologized to profusely. And even after the 60-plus page report came out from the college's own investigators, that there was no racial bias, the staff members themselves received no apology. CARLSON: It just tells you everything. And you've explained it so crisply. And I appreciate that. Tracey Putnam Culver, thank you. CULVER: Thank you. CARLSON: Jason Hill is a College Professor; he works at DePaul University, and we're happy to have him tonight. Professor, you've obviously chosen to spend your life on college campuses, as you watch this story unfold, what's your reaction? JASON HILL, PROFESSOR, DEPAUL UNIVERSITY: Well, I'm not surprised because I think that what we're seeing is a form of new liberal white supremacy that is being promulgated by national security threats in the person of people like Ibram Kendi and Robin DiAngelo, who are what I call the new liberal white supremacists who are conducting these sensitivity racial training workshops and anti-racist workshops, which are nothing more than workshops that prepare young people to see grievances and racism where they do not exist. And I think they are spreading a kind of divisiveness in our nation and equipping blacks and other minorities to act with full forethought of malice, to issue nefarious claims against white people. And what they're doing is they're saying so long as you have white skin, DiAngelo does this, Ibram Kendi does this, you are a walking practitioner of racism. And let me say this, I think that what has happened since the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act is that I think a lot of blacks really, in my private forthcoming book called ""What do White Americans Owe Black People: Racial Justice in the Age of Post-Oppression"" is that a lot of blacks, Tucker, are going through what I call an existential identity crisis. That is their identities were forged in the crucible of real oppression. Now that they're free, and they've lost the kind of cosmic specialness, they don't know what to do with their lives. And these new liberal white supremacists have honed in like vultures and have told them that you need to continue the drama. You need to continue your careers of being victims. And there are two ways that you can do this. One is you can continue the drama of victimology. And one way to do it is by understanding that black skin grants you the imprimatur of innocence, which puts you outside the pale of being questioned. So if you are stamped within perimeter of innocence, you are automatically stamped with signal of sainthood, which puts you outside of being questioned and B, all white people by virtue of having white skin are automatic racists, which condemns them indefinitely as your oppressors. And I think this is what we are seeing happening. Black people are being weaponized to be psychological weapons of mass destructions or destroyers and it is terribly divisive. So I'm not very, very surprised, because it's also not surprising that as America grows increasingly less racist, we are seeing on college campuses, a march for re-segregation, right? Where blacks are calling for separate dorms, separate graduation ceremonies. Since 2017, on 70 college campuses now, we have separate graduation ceremonies for blacks. So I'm not really surprised at all, because we're living in a different kind of era. CARLSON: It's hard to see who is benefiting, only a small group. Most people are being really hurt by this of all colors, I would say. Professor, I appreciate your coming on tonight. Congrats on the book. I hope you'll come back. HILL: Thank you. CARLSON: So maybe the most important job if you're the President is to live with the fact that you're the only person with authority to launch nuclear weapons. But Democrats in Washington like to strip that power from Joe Biden. What? Democrats in Washington are saying Joe Biden shouldn't have the sole authority to launch nuclear weapons. Why are they saying that? A fascinating story, that's next. CARLSON: Well, here's the story that came out of nowhere and no one expected. Over 30 House Democrats are asking Joe Biden to renounce his authority, which as President, he alone holds to launch nuclear weapons. Now, why would they ask him to do that? That doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Unless they know things about Joe Biden, the rest of us don't. What could those be? Congressman Matt Gaetz represents the State of Florida in the United States Congress. We're happy to have him on tonight to decode this mystery. Congressman, thanks very much for coming on. I don't think you know, six months ago, anyone would have put money on the possibility that Democrats would ask newly elected Joe Biden to relinquish his nuclear authority. What is this? Why are they asking him to do this? REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): It's not just any Democrats. Matter of fact, this is Jimmy Panetta leading the effort. He's on the House Armed Services Committee, very focused on national security and very serious. So, I don't know what these Democrats know about the mental acuity and capability of Joe Biden. What I do know is that a nuclear flashpoint is not one of the times when we need a Washington based committee meeting. I think that there are many places where our founders wanted the government to operate slowly so that our rights would be protected. But certainly, in a nuclear crisis, we ought to be able to respond swiftly with a Commander-in-Chief fully vested in the authority that the Constitution vests. CARLSON: Are they sending a message that they'll get back to later when AOC and the rest tried and forced Biden to leave because he's not up to the job? I mean, is this -- are they laying the groundwork for something here? GAETZ: Well, it is an early time in the Biden presidency to be raising the issue of mental competence. CARLSON: Yes. GAETZ: Remember, President Trump warned Joe Biden that if this was an issue, he would likely be the first victim to have power stripped from him. But as you know, Tucker, the greatest threat we face right now is not of Civil War, or I'm sorry, of nuclear war, it is of the degradation of our civil liberties as a consequence of our capital being occupied. CARLSON: Well, I wanted to ask you about that, by the way, so ""The Intercept"" reported the other day and we did some reporting and verified that it's absolutely right, that lawmakers phone records were swept up in F.B.I. requests for data on people at the Capitol on January 6th. The F.B.I. nabbing data from your phone as an elected official, can that be legal? Will the Congress put up with it? What's the status? GAETZ: Again, I think the biggest threat facing the country right now is the inward turning of these national security authorities against our own people for politics. And really, that began in 2016 with the Russia hoax, but now the F.B.I. used a geo fencing tool to be able to extract records from anyone within a specific geography. And so, you've got to ask yourself, if the entire United States Congress can get caught, possibly inadvertently, in this massive power of the Federal government, what can they do to the rest of us? What can they do to regular Americans that see their financial institutions turning over records that see their capital wrapped in barbed wire that see more and more a fusion of government and Big Business against their rights and their interests? CARLSON: It's remarkable. As far as I know, you're one of very few Republicans saying anything about this. We're obviously glad that you are. I hope you'll keep it up. Congressman Gaetz, thank you. GAETZ: Thank you, Tucker. CARLSON: Liz Cheney hasn't said anything about it that we're aware of. Liz Cheney represents the State of Wyoming in the Congress. She's an ascendant figure in the Republican Party. She hopes to be Speaker of the House. She gave a fascinating speech the other day. We will tell you what she said. CARLSON: When you think of an authoritarian leader, you picture some power mad autocrat, working fiercely defend his own regime. You think of Nicolae Ceausescu pacing his study, steady, plotting diabolical new ways to smash the latest peasant revolt. And that's right, but it's not the full picture. Reality is more complicated than that. Fascism is a style of government, but it's also a form of religion. So the goal isn't simply to make you obey, the goal is to convert you. Before he executed his political rivals, Stalin forced victims to profess their love for him and for the Soviet State. He staged a kind of religious ritual. Stalin claimed to be an atheist, but he was in fact closer to the kind of secular Ayatollah. Why are we telling you this? Because you're seeing the same impulses at work now here in this country. It wasn't enough for Democrats to win control of the entire Federal government in November, they got the power they wanted, but it did not satisfy them. They barely paused to celebrate. In fact, they seemed angrier. Why? Here's why. Because there were still Americans out there who disagreed with them, and thinking about that made it hard for them to sleep, it agitated them and the numbers show it. According to one new survey, the single most pressing issue for Democratic voters right now is the existence of Trump voters. Not inflation, not drug ODs, not the teetering national economy, not even global warming. It's people who don't share their views. Democrats believe they're the real threat. It's amazing how disconnected from reality this is. There aren't that many Americans left to dare to disobey the emerging techno state. The few who remain have never had less power than they have now. At this point, the pockets of resistance to corporate conformity are scattered and diffused. They are gun shop owners and commercial fishermen at sea, a few free thinking families living in outer suburbs 30 miles from the city, three guys on a smoke break behind a transmission shop in Bangor, a noncompliant waitress in Brooklyn. In other words, the least powerful people in our society. You don't see people like that on television very often. But they do exist and Democrats know they exist. So they won't rest until every last one of them, every last apostate has embraced the one true faith, by force if necessary. Democrats definitely want new laws. But more than that, they want their catechism repeated back to them by the entire population and that's why they spend so much energy, a stunning amount of energy, if you think about it, trying to police speech. They care what you think even more than they care about what you do. They need you to agree with them. So they force you to mouth their slogans. ""Diversity is our strength. Climate change is an existential threat. The riot at the Capitol was a white supremacist insurrection."" The more absurd the claim is, the more hysterically they demand that you repeat it. At the moment, Democrats are completely fixated on forcing you to agree that yes, January 6th was a racist event. And it's been fascinating to see who in America complies with this demand to say that out loud. In a speech this week, Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney of Wyoming decided to obey. Here she is talking about the riot at the Capitol. Watch. REP. LIZ CHENEY (R-WY): It's very important for us to ignore the temptation, to look away. And it's very important, especially for us as Republicans to make clear that we aren't the party of white supremacy. CARLSON: Oh, so it's very important, she says, to make it clear that as Republicans, we are not the party of white supremacy. Okay. But who claims otherwise? Who is saying the Republican Party is the party of white supremacy? It is a corporate party. Sure. It's the embarrassing party, often. It's the stupid party, definitely. But the white supremacy party? Only Democrats and their propagandists in the media say that and now Liz Cheney, because some guy brought a Confederate flag to a rally. It's strange. When Jeffrey Epstein got arrested, you didn't see Adam Schiff giving defensive sounding speeches about how we've really got to make absolutely certain no one thinks we're the party of child molesters. Right? Schiff never even considered giving that speech. No Democrat did. Democrats don't reflexively parrot the slurs of their enemies. They don't hate themselves. They're not morons. Liz Cheney isn't a moron, she is smart. Her self-regard seems fully intact, too. So it's not she hates herself. More likely, Liz Cheney just knows what she needs to say in order to get what she wants. What Liz Cheney wants is an expanded American military presence around the world, more wars in the Middle East. Cheney is sincere about this, this is not a pose. She's a genuine old- fashioned neocon, an ideologue who means every word she says about killing people in faraway places. She's not kidding. In order to get those new wars, Cheney can't stray too far from the rest of the war lobby in Washington. She's long been close to Bill Kristol. She made certain to smirk at Donald Trump when he said pull the troops out of Afghanistan. This summer, Cheney was quick to denounce the quote, ""horrific murder"" of George Floyd, long before anyone could really say whether it was a horrific murder or a fentanyl OD. But Liz Cheney didn't wait for the facts to emerge. She dutifully read the script, and she's still reading the script. Here's Liz Cheney suggesting that any news organization that aired questions about election fraud, presumably, including this, bears moral responsibility for the Capitol riot of January 6th, and that's why, Liz Cheney says, we're going to need a quote ""9/11 style commission"" to get to the bottom of it all, because really, people, January 6th was a lot like 9/11. Thousands dead. CHENEY: I think that, you know, any media organization that was perpetuating the notion, continues to perpetuate the notion that the election was fraudulent or was stolen, is contributing to a very dangerous set of circumstances. And I think, the American people need to know the truth about what happened. CARLSON: Oh, the American people need to know the truth about what happened. Well, yes, they do. We agree with that completely. Thanks to silly propaganda, like the clips we just played, there is some confusion about who exactly was at the Capitol on January 6th. Was it really a gang of white supremacists? We've heard that a lot, so we looked into it. We went through the list compiled by the Department of Justice of the 199 people arrested for breaching the Capitol grounds that day, then we looked them up. How many of them were open racists? By our count, five of them. Five people out of 199 people arrested. Racism is bad. More than any show on television, we make that point endlessly. We oppose hurting people on the basis of their race, no matter who is doing it, no matter how they are justifying it. So again, we are always against racism, but five people out of 199 arrested? How is that a white supremacist insurrection? If it is, then we have other questions such as, how many black supremacists are there at your average BLM riot? We don't know the answer to that because no journalist would ever ask that question. The media are happy instead to take BLM purely at face value. We're here because we're mad about police brutality, says BLM. Okay, say the reporters furiously transcribing. Did anyone ask the people at the Capitol on January 6th why they were there? No one we have seen in the countless videos of that day was yelling about an ethno state or trying to harm people because of their skin color or even complaining about affirmative action. Why? Because the rally wasn't about race at all. And neither was the riot. It was about the election. The people at the Capitol really believed the presidential election was unfair, and they had reason to believe that and not because of any nonsense about rigged voting machines. Silicon Valley really did weight the scales in this election in an unprecedented and completely immoral way. That is true. Big Tech attacked our democracy much more effectively than any foreign power ever has. Social media platforms censored criticism of Joe Biden and promoted criticism of Donald Trump. In the final weeks of the campaign, Google sabotaged the Republican Campaign's fundraising and get out the vote efforts by throttling reminders and solicitations on their way to the G- mail accounts of Trump supporters. That actually happened and many more things like it. So it wasn't entirely the protesters' imagination. Here's the question, has Liz Cheney or any other Republican done anything about that? They're outraged by the riot, so were we. But do they actually care why it happened? Is there a quote ""9/11 style Commission"" on the way that's going to uncover the full extent of Google and Twitter and Facebook's crimes against our democracy and finally hold them all accountable? We haven't heard of that 9/11 style Commission. Instead, we've heard Liz Cheney and countless other Members of Congress, talk about the people at the Capitol like they're al Qaeda and should be droned. And maybe they will be droned someday, like the terrorist that Washington claims they are. Before that happens, here's something you should know. And no, it is not an excuse for rioting. Nothing is an excuse for rioting, as we have said consistently on the show since Memorial Day. But this is true, and therefore it's worth telling you about. Most of the people at the Capitol on January 6th we're not racists, but most of them were poor. We know this because ""The Washington Post"" did an analysis of their finances. Who knows why the paper did that, but here's what they found. Nearly 60 percent of the people charged with crimes on January 6th had serious financial problems, including overwhelming debt, foreclosures, evictions and unpaid taxes. As a group, they were about twice as likely as the average American to have declared bankruptcy. Twenty five percent had been sued at some point by creditors, a fifth face losing their home to the bank. One protester from San Diego, a veteran called Ashli Babbitt found herself so deeply in debt trying to keep her small business afloat that she took out a loan for $65,000.00 at an interest rate of 169 percent. In the end, she didn't have to pay it back. A still unnamed Capitol Hill police officer shot Ashli Babbitt in the throat that day and killed her. Now Ashli Babbitt is being denounced as a white supremacist. There's no evidence that she was. There was a lot of evidence that Ashli Babbitt was a patriotic American who was reckless and angry. Why was she angry? She'd been left behind by our economy. She was disgusted by the corruption of our most powerful institutions. Those are the real reasons. Liz Cheney doesn't want to talk about those reasons. She wants to continue talking about Donald Trump and racism and white supremacy. Are you sensing a theme here? They're covering their tracks, all of them. Well, members of both parties are celebrating the collapse of Neera Tanden's nomination to be the next Budget Director, but not Eric Swalwell. Swalwell was asking a simple question. Simple man, simple question. And it's this: what message does this send children of South Asian descent who will also aspire someday to berate their employees, humiliate harassment victims and steal oil from Libya? What about them? We will answer Eric Swalwell, next. CARLSON: Well, we suspected this moment was coming. We didn't know it would get here so fast. Everything is happening fast now, just 36 days into Joe Biden's administration. We've just learned that the United States has launched airstrikes and several facilities in Syria tonight. We don't know exactly what those facilities are. Of course, we never will know exactly what they are. But the operation The Pentagon has just told us quote, ""Sends a clear and unambiguous message. President Biden will act to protect American and coalition personnel."" Okay, maybe someone can explain that in greater detail. Of course, the strike did send another message, a more important one that everyone in Washington can hear. The defense industry, permanent D.C. now have their man back in the White House. That didn't take long. For four years, they longed, more than maybe anything for more pointless conflict in the Middle East. And just 36 days in, now they have it. Well, more Washington news. Neera Tanden's nomination to be the next Budget Director seems to be collapsing. And according to California, Congressman Eric Swalwell, it's obvious why that's happening. He diagnosed the problem on Twitter. Obviously, it's systemic racism, quote, ""I represent,"" said one of the dumbest people ever to serve, "" ... one of the largest Indian- American districts in the United States. How do I look at what's happening to Neera Tanden and tell little girls of South Asian descent that they'll have the same opportunities in life as white men."" Now, you might think that Eric Swalwell has a lot of options here. For example, you could tell a little girl of South Asian descent not to punch reporters. You tell them not to cover up sexual assault, mock their political opponents in ways that are just pointlessly vicious, call U.S. senators Russian agents, tell Members of Congress they belong in jail, that would be a start. That helps your career when you pull back a little. Maybe Eric Swalwell could also tell young girls of South Asian descent not to advocate invading Libya, and stealing its oil to pay down the national debt. He might even tell them, you know, maybe shouldn't cover up sexual harassment. But saying that would be racist. And Eric Swalwell isn't the only one who knows that. Bill Kristol, a longtime defender of abusers who have the right politics said the same thing on television this week. BILL KRISTOL, FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF TO THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Neera Tanden is a kind of a tough cookie and should be good at that job from a sort of moderate Republican point of view. So I don't really know what Manchin is up to. I suspect there are other things going on that is his professed reason. I do think there's a little bit of, and again, I say this as though he doesn't usually play this card. But I think there's a little misogyny here. I mean, the one person he chooses to oppose is a woman of color. CARLSON: Okay, so she is for destructive neocon politics, so we support her. We can't say that out loud, because nobody likes destructive neocon politics. So instead, we say she's a woman of color, it is racism. You know, you hate to play their stupid divisive game of breaking everyone down by racial metrics. But since they're doing it, how big a lie is this? I mean, let's just be completely honest, Asian Americans have the highest per capita income of any ethnic group in America, good for them. But let's be real. The household income of an Indian American family on average is 120 grand a year. That surpasses all ethnic groups, including white Americans. So Eric Swalwell telling young South Asian girls that they don't have a chance is ridiculous. We'd like to know what he is telling the Chinese spies he is sleeping with. That'd be much more interesting. Maybe he'll tweet that or come on the show and tell us. As you were having sex with a Chinese spy, what did you tell her? Invitations always open. Well, Rachel Levine is the Biden administration's nominee for Assistant Secretary of Health. Prior to that nomination. Rachel Levine was best known for overseeing thousands of nursing home deaths in Pennsylvania, but you're not supposed to worry about that, because Rachel Levine identifies as transgender and uses ""she"" and ""her"" pronouns. So it's historic. Rachel Levine believes anyone can identify as transgender even eight year old boys. And if that means minors getting gender reassignment surgery, castration or giving them puberty blockers, it is totally fine. Rand Paul had a few questions about this today at a hearing, here's how it went. SEN. RAND PAUL (R-KY): I'm alarmed that you won't say with certainty that minors should not have the ability to make the decision to take hormones that will affect them for the rest of their life. Will you make a more firm decision on whether or not minors should be involved in these decisions? RACHEL LEVINE, NOMINEE FOR ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF HEALTH: Senator, transgender medicine is a very complex and nuanced field, and if confirmed to the position of Assistant Secretary of Health, I would certainly be pleased to come to your office and talk with you and your staff about the standards of care and the complexity of this field. PAUL: Let it go into the record that the witness refused to answer the question. The question is a very specific one, should minors be making these momentous decisions? CARLSON: Simple question. Tammy Bruce is the President of Independent Women's Voice, and she joins us to assess. Tammy, great to see you tonight. So I guess what bothers me about this is once again, using the cover of identity politics or someone's personal choices to cloak public policy questions that the rest of us have a right to answers to. And I think that's what we just saw. TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. Well, it is. And what we're also seeing is the insult to transgender people, and even with your Neera Tanden segment. It's the same position there. It's the choosing of people because they fit on a game board in some position, regardless of their competency, and you've got Tanden, you've got Levine, you've got Becerra, who are completely incompetent, and yet they check a box. And of course, instead of asking, what can you accomplish? How good are you? We ask, or certainly, the Biden administration left asks, what are you? You know, how are you going to look? And this is what leads us down to this problem. And it eliminates the ability and they think you're not supposed to criticize or ask hard questions. Already, Rand Paul is being called a transphobe, but it really is about regardless of your position on transgenderism, these are children. Children do not understand concepts. We don't let them decide what everyone is going to have for dinner. We don't allow them to do the shopping for a reason. They're immature. Their brains are not finished growing yet. Their bodies are not finished. And yet, this should be the simplest answer in the world. But now it's wrapped up in leftist politics. And, you know, I applaud Rand Paul for asking because you know, you're not supposed to -- you're not supposed to ask Neera Tanden questions, and when it comes to who you are transgender or an Asian American woman, the issue becomes be the best person you can be and demand that if you're going to be chosen, some person from your group is going to be chosen for a high job, that they know what they're doing, and that they're not jerks. Levine has been responsible for the horrible COVID response in Pennsylvania. She -- according to ""The New York Times"" six out of the 10 worst nursing home disaster -- nursing homes are in Pennsylvania. She moved her own mother out of a nursing home into a hotel just before she issued the order forcing nursing homes to accept COVID patients. That's who this person is. She's an embarrassment. She should -- the transgender community should be appalled. Let's not look for historic, let's look for good so that we can actually get on our feet. CARLSON: Just plain competent would be historic given where we're going. It's unbelievable. BRUCE: Yes. CARLSON: Tammy, great to see you. Thank you for that clear explanation. BRUCE: Small requirement. Yes. CARLSON: It's a small requirement. BRUCE: Thank you. CARLSON: Well, we've known for years that our leaders are willing to humiliate themselves for Chinese amusement. What we didn't know is our leaders are literally willing to bend over and expose themselves to Xi Jinping orders, but they have been, not making that up. Details ahead. CARLSON: A lot of our leaders dislike this country they say so out loud. America's politicians and diplomats aren't proud that they represent the United States, they're embarrassed. China for all its many faults doesn't have that problem. They still have some respect. The respect hasn't been completely erased through years of state funded Robin DiAngelo lectures and high definition pedophilia films by Netflix. Well, today, we learned that China is still something else we've lost, a sense of humor. The State Department complains that officials in Beijing compromised the dignity of American diplomats by forcing them to submit to rectal coronavirus tests. And here's the worst part. Apparently, some of our diplomats complied, dropped their pants and did it before they realized it was a joke, which it was. Beijing is now claiming the rectal coronavirus tests were given in error. They still have a sense of humor. Where's our self-respect is the question. Before we go tonight, a quick but sincere Happy Birthday to the best executive producer on television, Justin Wells, who runs the show. Our new Vice President at FOX. He won't give his age, but we're grateful that he works here. We'll be back every week night at 8:00 p.m. The show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. Guess who's next? Sean Hannity, the Great Sean Hannity. SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: That wasn't very warm. Guess who is next? Hannity. You know. I am teasing. CARLSON: But it was meant with great love. HANNITY: All right, thank you, Tucker. Classification"
2021-02-08,"TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. Happy Monday. Some medical news for you off the top. Last month, the C.D.C. issued a press release that begins this way, quote, ""The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is expanding the requirement for a negative COVID-19 test to all air passengers entering the United States. Testing before and after travel is a critical layer to slow the introduction and spread of COVID-19. This strategy is consistent with the current phase of the pandemic and more efficiently protects the health of Americans."" Got that. It's all about the health of Americans, and that's why every human being who enters this country by air must first present a negative test for the coronavirus that includes American citizens, there are no exceptions. Corona infection, in fact, is the one universal reality of the human condition. We are all potential incubators of this deadly virus. But it doesn't end there. Travelers who test negative for COVID must still wear masks at all times, and that includes while onboard the airplane or while walking through the airport. If you don't have a mask on, you had better be actively chewing, otherwise prepare for a steep fine and the possibility of never flying again. Nor is one mask necessarily enough. Tony Fauci has announced we ought to consider wearing three masks at once, a paper petticoat for your face. That's how serious our government is about fighting this global pandemic. But of course, you knew that, you've watched it. You know that the risk is imminent and profound enough that your children likely have been out of school for a year. Your business may be shut down right now. Your parents may have died alone, unable to hold your hand in the final days. The United States itself bears no resemblance to the place you once knew 12 months ago. But those are the sacrifices you have been asked to make, and you have and for good reason. COVID is dangerous. It's existentially dangerous, they keep telling us. The authorities are more than willing to destroy your family and your country in order to protect you from this virus. That's their public position stated every day. Do they actually mean it when they say it though? Those pictures of California Governor Gavin Newsom eating a maskless dinner in a crowded room with the most expensive restaurant in America were one indication that no, maybe they're not entirely sincere about their COVID policies. Maybe it's kind of a sham. Maybe there's one standard for you, a member of the despised and much bullied plebe class, and another very different standard for politically favored groups who can do whatever they want. Now, you'd hate to think that could be true in a country like this, a country with such a long and noble history of egalitarianism and equality under the law. Unfortunately, there has been growing evidence of that double standard. Now there's hard proof. Tonight, we've learned that Joe Biden administration is releasing thousands of foreign nationals living here illegally into American neighborhoods without bothering to test them for the coronavirus. People from countries with high infection rates within in crowded conditions set forth into the American population, like COVID isn't real. That's happening. It is the official policy of the U.S. government. On Friday, the White House was asked about this policy, and here was the response. QUESTION: The U.S. Customs and Border Protection is saying that they're having to catch and release some migrants without giving them any kind of COVID test before they are entering the community. So what is being done? What could be done? JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Are you -- are you suggesting they're letting people in across the border without testing them? Or tell me a little bit more -- QUESTION: They are being released -- they are having to because of the Executive Order that the President signed earlier this week. PSAKI: Which executive -- which one? CARLSON: Yes, which one? COVID infected illegal aliens released into the United States? Whatever. It's not like there's a pandemic. The Press Secretary didn't care enough to answer the question. No big deal. Can I remind you that our Treasury Secretary is a woman? Shut up. You've been empowered. But people who know the details of what is going on right now feel very differently and they are worried. Brandon Judd runs the Border Patrol Union. We do not test the illegal aliens we release, Judd told the show, quote: ""So we're releasing people without knowing which obviously puts the public at risk."" Well, yes, it obviously does. Leon Wilont is the Cheriff of Yuma County, Arizona. Last week he wrote a letter to one of his senators, Democrat Kyrsten Sinema will not call the Biden administrations new policy quote, ""a particularly dangerous approach."" As he put it, quote, ""There is currently no protocol for testing any of these people for the COVID-19 virus nor is there any support being offered by the Federal government to house, feed, medically treat, or transport these immigrants,"" and that's why in some places, taxpayers are paying for foreign nationals who should be deported to live in hotel rooms. Unlike you, they're not paying for your hotel room. But if that seems crazy, disconnected from reality, it is a small part of the Biden administration's immigration policy, a policy that seems designed to hurt the United States as profoundly as possible. In an internal memo sent last week, I.C.E. officials announced the administration is suspending something called Operation Talon. That operation targeted sex offenders, but no more. Illegal alien sex offenders are now a protected class. Then a day after that, another internal I.C.E. memo announced the quote: ""Effective immediately, the Biden administration would stop deporting illegal aliens who have been convicted of drug offenses, assault, DUI, money laundering, property crimes, fraud, tax evasion, or who have gang tattoos."" Going forward to any illegal alien charged with a crime, but not yet convicted of a crime would also be safe from deportation. So what does all of that mean in practice? Well, it means for example, that an MS-13 member arrested for drug dealing with previous convictions for say, theft, extortion, grand larceny, would have to be released back into the United States, maybe into your neighborhood, even if he had been deported many times before. That's not some crazy hypothetical, by the way. Things like that will happen. A foreign national charged with rape, but who flees before trial -- and that happens quite a bit -- cannot be deported either. Technically, he hasn't been convicted of rape, so deporting him would be an act of bigotry, and so on. This is all real, and we will see cases like that guaranteed. The question is motive. Why are they doing this? Even if you thought the United States badly needed more low-skilled workers in the middle of an employment crisis, even if you believe that, even if you believe that your right to cheap housekeeping is more important than the right of the American middle class to exist, and many of our leaders emphatically do believe that, how exactly do you explain suspending the hunt for sex offenders? How is that a good idea for anyone? How is it a good idea to release illegal aliens in the middle of a pandemic without even testing them for the coronavirus? How does all of that conceivably help you as an American, as someone who pays for all of this stuff? Well, of course, it doesn't help you. But helping you is not the point. No one is even pretending the point of this was to help you. It's the opposite. The point is to punish you. When we release people who break our laws without even bothering to test them for the virus, the same virus we've used as a pretext for wrecking your life, what we're really saying in the clearest possible terms is: we don't like you. This isn't a policy. It's an act of aggression. It's designed to humiliate you and demoralize you. Reckless and destructive immigration policy is the penalty you are paying for your white supremacy. It's almost too dark to believe that's their motive, too dark to believe it's real, but it is. And over on MSNBC, they're saying it out loud. YAMICHE ALCINDOR, MSNBC POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR: Underscoring all of this as we talk on this racial reckoning is xenophobia, it is racism, it is white supremacy. What -- how when you separate brown children, especially from their mothers, we have to ask ourselves, how was that allowed to happen? And what role did white supremacy play in that? NICOLLE WALLACE, MSNBC HOST: Absolutely. I mean, I think that's at the root of all of these conversations. CARLSON: It's not the root of all these conversations, it is a smokescreen. None of these conversations have anything to do with race whatsoever. It's about protecting the American population. Period. Joining us now is AJ Louderback. He is the Jackson County Sheriff. We're happy to have you with us, Sheriff Louderback. AJ LOUDERBACK, SHERIFF, JACKSON COUNTY, TEXAS: Thanks, Tucker. Glad to be with you. CARLSON: Is it true in the State of Texas, that people who have been detained because they're not here legally, they are foreign nationals, are being released without coronavirus tests? LOUDERBACK: That's absolutely true. Absolutely true. It's even -- if I could continue, Tucker, the memo -- the memo that I received this last week, it is essentially a defund the I.C.E. by memo, by a memorandum that was sent out by David Pekoske on January 20, 2021. So this is a particularly devastating document, protections for Americans here in the United States. The message really has been sent -- when I read it first and looked at it, it is a message to the world you can come here illegally. You could commit crimes here against Americans and remain here illegally. CARLSON: But of all things, the coronavirus, since Americans are now being told in the near future we may not be allowed to fly on airplanes domestically without being proven free of the virus without a certificate that says we've been tested and are negative. How in a country like that, could we just forget to test illegal aliens for the virus before releasing them? Like how did that happen, do you know? LOUDERBACK: No, I'm sure I wouldn't have forgot an item. You know, I don't know, but in the haste to open the border for everyone in this country, the -- I mean, this is something that I expected to some degree. We walked this path from 2008 to 2016. This program that was released by memorandum is very similar to the Priority Enforcement Program from in 2014-2015 where people were able to commit crimes here against Americans. The COVID issue conveniently overlooked during this time, so, you know, I struggle for a thought process like many Americans and Texans on how administration can conduct themselves in this manner, and promote a lawless attitude here where people are going to get hurt and seriously injured, killed, and people allowed to stay here, which is unbelievable. Yet here we sit with this situation. CARLSON: Yes. In a country where you're not allowed to go to church or go to funerals, because of coronavirus. Are you worried about the effects of this? What do you think the effects will be? LOUDERBACK: Irreparable harm, Tucker. Yes, we're worried every police officer in the United States should be should be extremely concerned about the attitude, the lawlessness, the complete abject removal of law. We have a nullification of the law here going on. It's not we're going to -- we're not going to enforce anything. We're going to allow our C.B.P. and our I.C.E. officers, U.S.C.I.S. is all three were affected by this memo, which effectively guts the I.N.A. and handcuffs them where they're unable to respond. So in law enforcement here, those of us who do not have the jurisdiction to enforce the Federal laws here, we have created a situation here which is unthinkable for the public. The public has no idea, the strength of a memorandum that's been filed here in the United States by this administration. So it's -- you know, I think it's our job and I appreciate, you know, your program and inviting me on here to get the word out, and spread what's happened here, and what's happening right before our very eyes, what this administration is doing. CARLSON: Well, we appreciate you telling us the truth, Sheriff. Sheriff Louderback, great to see you tonight. LOUDERBACK: Absolutely. CARLSON: Thank you. LOUDERBACK: Thank you. CARLSON: Well, one place where the ruling party does believe in law enforcement is in Washington, where they live and work. The nation's capital under military occupation tonight. The Pentagon today telling us how much it's going to cost taxpayers. Listen carefully. REAR ADMIRAL JOHN KIRBY (RET.): The estimate through March 15th is that the total cost of National Guard support will come to $483 million, $284 million of that is for personnel, and $199 million of that is for operations and that gets us through March 15th. CARLSON: Razor wire soldiers in your nation's capital, no explanation why they are there. No explanation of the mission itself. We now know roughly what it will cost. This is one of those stories that's playing out right in front of us, and yet is being almost completely ignored by the rest of the media. We thought it'd be interesting to take a look at what is actually happening in Washington. Richie McGinniss will take us there. He's a reporter with ""The Daily Caller."" We're happy to have him on tonight. Richie, give us a sense of what the city is like tonight. RICHIE MCGINNISS, REPORTER, ""THE DAILY CALLER"": Tucker, it's truly a shocking scene down here in front of the Capitol. I've been in D.C. for 12 years, and I've never seen anything like this before. As you can see, we have the concertina or razor wire along the top of the fence. And in all the protests zones that I've been to over the last year, I haven't seen razor wire a top a fence like this and to see it around the halls of our democracy is quite shocking. CARLSON: So you came pretty close to gunfire in Wisconsin this summer. We interviewed you at the time. I think we have a couple of times you went to a bunch of different riots and demonstrations. From my understanding, there was a very light law enforcement presence at a lot of those things, contrast that with what you see tonight in Washington. MCGINNISS: Yes, Tucker, actually the last time that we spoke was after the riot at the Capitol, and if there ever was an example of being light on law enforcement, I think that was definitely the case on January 6, as well as in Kenosha where we saw protesters in great numbers and law enforcement, obviously having a difficult time keeping law and order there. So we've seen this happen before. But obviously, that's not the case tonight with the National Guardsmen and Capitol Police manning all the checkpoints of this fencing. CARLSON: Have you gotten -- as someone who lives and works in Washington - - have you gotten a clear explanation as to why these soldiers are in the city? MCGINNISS: No, I have not, Tucker. I have not gotten any explanation. And I do understand that Mayor Muriel Bowser does not want the fence to remain permanent, but that remains to be seen whether or not this this fence will stay up. CARLSON: It's really an amazing, an amazing moment. Richie McGinniss thank you for that reality check. I appreciate it. MCGINNISS: Thank you, Tucker. CARLSON: How crazy are things getting? Not just in Washington, but in TV Land more broadly. A prominent news anchor now suggesting the use of drone strikes against American citizens who have the wrong politics. It's got to be peak lunacy. We'll talk to someone who has thought a lot about how this country got here and how we can get out of it. That's straight ahead. CARLSON: Well, it used to be there was a time, as they say, when most sane people in this country believe that bombing American citizens with military drone strikes in this country just because you don't like their politics, a little over the top, maybe a little too far. Maybe not the unity we were looking for but things have changed. Supporters of Donald Trump, it turns out were so dangerous that maybe they do deserve hellfire missiles raining down on their homes. Watch. WALLACE: We had a policy and it was very controversial, it was carried out under the Bush years and under the Obama years of attacking terrorism at its root, of going after and killing, and in the case of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American, and again many American with a drone strike for the crime of inciting violence, inciting terrorism. Mitch McConnell was in the Senate then. He was in the Senate after 9/11, too. How does Mitch McConnell who understands that the way you root out terrorism is to take on in the case of Islamic terrorism kill those who incite it? How does he not vote to convict someone that he said on the floor of the Senate incited an insurrection? CARLSON: Yes, okay, we play a lot of pretty over the top video on this show, particularly from that channel and that news anchor, save that tape. No matter what happens next, that will live forever as one of the craziest things ever said on cable television and one of the most ominous. But it's a sign of the moment we're in. The question is how do we get out of this moment? Well, we are bringing next a man who has thought and we think struck a hopeful note. Russ Vought was the Director of the White House Office of Management and Budget in the last administration. He's now the President for the Center for American Restoration, which is what we need. He joins us now. Russ, thanks so much for coming on. RUSS VOUGHT, FORMER DIRECTOR OF WHITE HOUSE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET: Thanks for having me, Tucker. CARLSON: So I don't think we need to make the case to our viewers that we're in an unprecedented time, people saying stuff like that on television, how do we get out of it? VOUGHT: Sure. I think what's important is that we need to remember to stay on offense on these particular issues in which they are pushing us at the front. These are the cultural issues. These are the America First issue. These are the issues, the theme that you've been talking about for many years, Tucker, and that's where the American people, the forgotten men and women across this country, this is where they want their people in Washington to fight for them, and not to go back to the business as usual four or five years ago. And so that's what this center is all about. We want to restore a political consensus in this country that we are for God, we are for country, and we are for community, and that our only way out of this is to keep building that country and to restore that consensus in this country. CARLSON: Do we have leaders who believe that and can articulate it, do you think? VOUGHT: I think we have some, but we need to build their ranks and we need to arm them. We need to provide a network of activists across the country that are right there willing to fight with them so that they can know and hear and have that encouragement. But we need people who are willing to stand in difficult tough fights in this town. It's easy to be for tax reform. It's easy to be for educational policy reform. It's hard to be for Big Tech reform. It is hard to get us out of endless wars. And so that's where we really need to keep fighting on those cultural America First issues. CARLSON: I get so distressed and discouraged looking at leaders in the Republican Party, not all of them, but I'm thinking of one in particular who has the most power in the Senate tweeted the other day that the real problem is Vladimir Putin, some internal thing he was doing of zero interest in most people I would say, including me. Can people like that be brought around to the obvious, which is you have to protect and serve your voters in order to justify your salary? VOUGHT: Time will tell, Tucker, but I think what's important is that we insist that these issues that we've been talking about for the last four or five years are the agenda. There's no going back. And so when we have leadership in the House and the Senate talking about trying to keep us in these wars, go back to passing the amnesty bills, that's where we've got to say no, we're not doing that and then to be able to look forward and to figure out, why is it that these issues and these ideas have taken so long to get on the agenda for Washington, D.C.? CARLSON: Yes. I mean, you're looking at it, as far as I can tell, a situation where everyone with power has one view, a very self-serving view, in my opinion, and then the majority of the country, regardless of partisan affiliation, on the issues is on the other side, like, what's the point of being in Afghanistan? Should we really open the borders? But it doesn't seem like the people with that view, the majority of you, have any power at all? VOUGHT: Well, that is one of the reasons why I think we've got to do voter integrity reform. We've got to do Big Tech reform. Because if we lose our voice, and right now, we are in danger of losing our voice, and your last segment just got at it with regard to how they are calling us all terrorists and insurrectionist. If we lose our voice, we've got no movement. And so this is a real precarious moment. It needs leadership, and our center is trying to rally leaders across this country to have a voice in Washington, D.C. CARLSON: Russ, I appreciate your hopeful position on this and the clarity of what you just said. Thank you. VOUGHT: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: Well, it won't surprise you that the party that hates nature -- at war with nature is not actually the party of science. More evidence tonight, the Biden administration just disavowed its own C.D.C. Director in favor of the teachers union. Details ahead. CARLSON: Well, the Centers for Disease Control has come out with a new study showing what every other study on the topic has shown since the beginning of this pandemic, schools are quote ""low transmission zones"" for the coronavirus. The C.D.C. Director Rochelle Walensky said it is safe for teachers to return to schools even before they have been vaccinated. But her party is not convinced. Last night, Joe Biden explained to the Democratic Party's donors and of course the biggest donors has always been the teachers unions -- are more important than the kids they teach. JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think it's time for schools reopen safely -- safely. You have to have fewer people in the classroom. You have to have ventilation systems that had been reworked. Our C.D.C. Commissioner was going to be coming out with science-based judgment within I think as early as Wednesday as to lay out what the minimum requirements are. CARLSON: So we've got to shake you down before we can open the schools. Dr. Marc Siegel joins us tonight to assess the science behind all of this. Doctor, good to see you. DR. MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR: Good to see, Tucker. ""Follow the science,"" said President Biden but that may not apply to teachers unions, right? So listen, what is the science? It's becoming clearer and clearer every day, the longer school stay closed, the more mental health problems there are, the more the C.D.C. itself is reporting more visits to mental health urgent care. And then there's this huge study out of North Carolina of 90,000 kids and teachers that showed only 32 cases of COVID and over 770 in the community itself. Clearly, COVID is not spreading in schools the way it is in the community. So follow the science, open the schools and sure enough, C.D.C. Director Rochelle Walensky said as much and she said it more than once last week and she said, yes teachers should be a priority to be vaccinated, but that's not the limiting step. And then I looked, and I saw press secretary Jen Psaki saying that she was talking in her personal capacity. Wait a minute. Personal capacity? You mean as the head of Infectious Diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital, one of the top infectious disease specialists in the world. That's her personal capacity. Anyway, moving on from that, they definitely should reopen to schools, Tucker, and I'll tell you why. Right here in the frontlines in New York City, a teacher went on a Zoom call today, Tucker, to his middle school children, and he announced our middle schools are opening finally on February 25th. And you know what he said? He said there were kids that came out that he didn't even though were there. He hadn't heard from them in months. They were rejoicing, they were celebrating, they were cheering. And one child who he hadn't even known was still in his class said two words, Tucker, ""Let's go."" Tucker. CARLSON: Great to see you, Dr. Siegel. Thank you. SIEGEL: Thank you. CARLSON: Well, over at ""The LA Times,"" a columnist called Virginia Heffernan is out with a new piece comparing her neighbors who she believes voted for Trump to terrorists and Nazis. What did they do wrong exactly? Well, it turns out they may have plowed the snow from her driveway. You might see that as an act of generosity, but to Virginia Heffernan who went to Harvard by the way, it was an act of violence. Heffernan wrote this, quote: ""Hezbollah, the Shiite Islamic political party in Lebanon also gives things away for free."" And then she added this all-time great observation, quote, ""Free driveway work, nice as it is, is just not the same currency as justice and truth,"" end quote, which apparently she alone gets to define, justice and truth. Virginia Heffernan in charge of justice and truth. There's something deep about this piece, something very revealing about the state of the country right now in the state of the left. Greg Gutfeld is the host ""The Greg Gutfeld Show,"" co-host to ""The Five,"" author of ""The Plus: Self--Help for People who Hate Self-Help."" He has thought deeply about what this column means because it does mean something and joins us now to explain. Greg Gutfeld, good to see you. GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST, THE GREG GUTFELD SHOW: Good to see you, Tucker. If I ever, Tucker, you have to make this promise to me, if I ever become a cartoon of myself, take me out and shoot me. Because I cannot tell if this person who wrote this is for real, or a cartoon of herself. An elitist writer for ""Harper's"" or Slate"" who has a pandemic getaway and a podcast with David Corn writes this piece in which she slams her good-natured neighbors, compares them to Hezbollah and Nazis because they cleared her driveway. I love this story almost to an obsessive degree, because I can't figure out if it's real. I mean, wouldn't she consider that they -- this might get back to her next door neighbor? To her scary right-wing neighbors might find out that Virginia Heffernan called the Nazis -- wouldn't that, like strike a little bit of concern? But she did it anyway. I want to know how the neighbors feel. I volunteer myself to go interview them. I probably actually might even know them. Who knows? Because they might even plow my driveway. Who knows? She might be my neighbor. It might be me. But I don't know. I don't know. I think that they deserve -- the neighbors deserve a response. I think the editors of ""The LA Times,"" probably should have done a better job in finding out some details, because there are no details in that story whatsoever about who they really are. But I go back to this. If it's fake, then she's an idiot. But if it's real, then she's worse than an idiot. She is a spiteful mean person to look at people through a political lens like that and to dehumanize them. And under this phony guise -- this phony guise that this article was about unification. She calls them Nazis. So she actually -- it was like a Trojan horse, that she actually went there and decided to label abuse on, I don't know, 74 million people because he's crazy or she's a liar. I can't tell which is which. And I don't want to -- by the way, Tucker, I don't want to impugn her and say she made this up. CARLSON: No, of course not. GUTFELD: I don't know. I don't know. All I know is, as an editor, it raises more questions than it answers. How is that? CARLSON: Well, it did. But what she reveals is what she and a lot of people in her world really think, which is that ideology is much more important than human kindness, relationships mean nothing compared to your ideas. GUTFELD: Yes. CARLSON: That's why -- that's what they were able to hold up Teddy Kennedy who killed a woman as a champion of women because he was for abortion. Like, that's kind of all they care about: it is ideology. GUTFELD: Yes. It's interesting, whenever there's a hurricane or whatnot, you always see the pickup trucks going in helping anybody. CARLSON: Right. GUTFELD: She's the type of person who probably wouldn't, because she is like, you need to have -- I'm sorry to say, you need to have Trump supporters in this world. I know that scary to liberals, but they're usually really useful. They know how to fix things. They know -- I have I said this before, a truck in Idaho is more useful than an Art Studies degree in Brooklyn. CARLSON: I agree with that. Hey, Virginia, see if you can keep the power grid going for a week. Can I just ask you since you make such a smart point? GUTFELD: Yes. CARLSON: Have you noticed that the angriest people in America are the ones with absolutely no useful skills. People like Virginia Heffernan, no useful skills, she does not know how to do anything. GUTFELD: By the way, yes, Tucker, I will -- I can't point that finger at anybody other than me. I have no useful skills whatsoever. I am pathetic with any kind of electrical devices. It's amazing that I'm even allowed outside my house because I am -- I'm a klutz. I just fell and landed on my tailbone, and sitting is excruciating, Tucker, but because I love you, I did the show anyway. CARLSON: That is really is the measure of love, isn't it? Well, I hope Virginia Heffernan gets back to you -- GUTFELD: Even though -- CARLSON: Even though, tell me? GUTFELD: You know what? I would plow your driveway any day, Tucker, I would do it. And that's no euphemism. It's the real deal. I will plow your driveway. CARLSON: I don't know -- I am not sure how to respond, but I'll take that as a compliment, the Great Greg Gutfeld. Thank you. GUTFELD: Thank you. CARLSON: So the entertainer, Ice Cube is bringing a class action suit against Robinhood, the app after Robinhood prevented its own users from buying shares. We will talk to his business partner about this suit. Why did they bring it? That's next. CARLSON: Last month, in really a pivotal moment in the history of our markets, the trading app, Robinhood, which is designed for retail investors to get involved in markets, normal people, stepped in and prevented its own users from buying dozens of stocks that include shares of GameStop and AMC. Robinhood wanted users to sell those shares. Why? In order to bail out hedge funds that had shorted those companies. Now the business partner of entertainer, Ice Cube is bringing a class action suit against Robinhood for doing that. Jeff Kwatinetz is the co-founder of Big3. He is a television and film producer, and as we said, a business partner of Ice Cube, he joins us tonight. Jeff, thanks for coming out. Why are you doing this? Tell us what the suit is about and what you hope to achieve? JEFF KWATINETZ, CO-FOUNDER, BIG3: Well, first of all, I just want to say that while Ice Cube always supports the little guy, this is in my using my Harvard Law degree with two class action lawyers from Florida. So I'm purely as a lawyer here. But I think, to take a step back is very important. It's important to question a system that gives rise to constant abuse of the 99 percent by the rich, powerful, and elite, and that's what happened here. In 1987, 2001, 2008, we see the abuse happen, and at the end of the day, people get bailed out, no one goes to jail, and the little guy gets caught holding the bag, and I think that's what happened here. You know, we have a problem in America, obviously, people have a problem trusting our institutions, and whether you're a Robinhood viewer, I mean user, or if you're someone else who just sees what happened, you distrust institutions because here it is happening again. So in this environment, along comes Robinhood, and they say we are going to support the little guy, we're going to democratize finance, and we have your back. And the truth is, Robinhood is nothing but another Wall Street wolf in sheep's clothing. What they did is they designed the perfect mousetrap. So they designed something to go capture people by giving free -- using the word free, which it turns out not to be -- giving out free stock, giving them more free stock if they bring in other people, gamifying it and basically pushing them into high risk trades like options and were encouraging it. And as it turns out, those are the exact types of users and trades that are worth a lot of money to people on Wall Street to so-called market makers who actually do the trades. And these guys aren't dumb, they came out of high frequency trading, they designed software to go after, you know, taking a penny out of every sell, a penny out of every buy. So they knew what they were creating. So what they've actually done is they've taken the customer, what you normally think of the customer at Robinhood, the trader, and they turn them into the product. They are essentially chum for the bigger wells and the wells are the same Wall Street people who invest in them, who will benefit by their IPO, and who are their counterparties. Now here's where it gets interesting. They created this monster to do this, but the monster got really big and it started to eat some of their own people and take advantage of it. So, you know, on Thursday, January 7th, we hear that, you know, we know that shorts, people betting against the stock, people who are trying to drive businesses out -- out of business, especially in the middle of a pandemic. I mean, that's pretty cold, right? These traders, you know, they're actually it turns out, they're not as inexperienced and stupid as Wall Street thinks, and they come up with a mechanism to all band together and start buying and by January 17, you know, hedge funds, other Wall Street players have lost somewhere between $18 billion and $20 billion. We know that a hedge fund named Melvin lost about, you know, $2.5 billion to $3 billion. So suspiciously on that day, the most important day, they come along and say, oh, you can only sell, you can't buy, which for any momentum stock and any attempt to do a short squeeze that ends it because that ends the momentum. CARLSON: Of course. KWATINETZ: Because you can only trade one way. CARLSON: Of course, but the whole thing is, you just pointed out and I don't think I've heard people say this enough, the whole thing was a scam from the first day. We will be following this. Jeff, I hope you will tell us how this turns out. Obviously, rooting for you and appreciate you coming on tonight. Thank you. KWATINETZ: I appreciate that. Enough is enough. We've got to stand up to people taking advantage of the 99 percent. CARLSON: I completely agree with that. Thank you. So if it has dawned on you at some point that the thread that connects a lot of seemingly unrelated actions on the part of the people in charge is, oh wait, they're mimicking China because they're aligned with China. If you imagine that, you should know you're not imagining that, because it's true. We'll speak to someone who's connected the dots after the break. CARLSON: Last night, Joe Biden promised to reverse the Trump administration's foreign policy on the question of China. According to Biden, the U.S. will now follow something called the International Rules of the Road. What does that mean exactly? Well, you can guess what it means. More subservience to the emerging nation of China. Most people don't understand how big this is, or how far back it goes, or the implications for them. Lee Smith understands. He's an author and a journalist. He's written one of the best pieces of the year on this topic for ""Tablet"" Magazine. The piece is called ""The 30 Tyrants."" You'll have to stop reading midway through because it's upsetting. But as you read it, you'll also know it's true. So we recommend that you do. He joins us tonight to explain. Lee, thanks so much for coming on. LEE SMITH, AUTHOR AND JOURNALIST: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: And for the mental energy required to connect all these dots in the piece, and again, I really hope our readers read it for themselves. But in the meantime, will you summarize your position. SMITH: Yes, I mean, basically, what I wanted to explain is I wanted to explain why so many things look crazy. Many things, for instance, that you cover on your show all the time, for instance, tonight, why people are coming across -- why people are coming across the border in such profound numbers? It all looks crazy until you realize there's a reason it's going on, and the reason is, is because the oligarchy that runs this country now is not primarily loyal to the United States. They do not care about the amount of damage they do to America. They don't care about the amount of damage they do to Americans, that's part of the system. Their primary loyalty is to their relationship to the Communist Chinese party. That is their center of gravity. It's the source of their wealth, privilege, and prestige. CARLSON: So keep connecting, if you will, and I hope sure that again, people will read this because print is really the only medium that can fully explain a thesis as complex as yours, but I think you're right. So what else would connect to that point that you just made? SMITH: Well, I mean, the big thing is starting -- I mean, one of the key dates is of course, it starts with Henry Kissinger's and Richard Nixon's opening to China. But really a big date as 1994 when Bill Clinton decided delink human rights and trade regarding China, right? The ambition -- you hear people say all the time, oh, we were hopeful that China would adopt more democratic policies. It was nonsense. The premier of China at the time was Jiang Zemin, this was the man who was catapulted to power after sending tanks into Tiananmen Square. So the American elite knew exactly what they were getting into. What they looked at, they looked at an enormous cheap labor pool. And they said, we're going to get rich and that's precisely what happened, where we are more than a quarter of a century along and that's precisely what's happened. Now, one of the interesting things that happened during the Donald Trump presidency because Donald Trump started calling these people out, I think that Donald Trump didn't even have that clear a sense of how tied in, how extensive this network was. One of the examples I mentioned is, for instance, whoever would have put Apple CEO Tim Cook and LeBron James in the same family album, but there they are, sure enough, because they both rely -- their wealth relies on the two same things: cheap Chinese labor and a growing Chinese consumer market. If you look across, this is not just -- it's not just entertainment. It's not just tech. It goes into the corporate world. It goes into finance. Unfortunately, it affects our government throughout. One of the most astonishing revelations was a memo that former D.N.I. John Ratcliffe wrote, regarding the C.I.A. regarding their intelligence analysis, C.I.A. management was apparently bullying analysts saying they didn't like their analysis of China, because they were worried about the policies that might encourage, meaning Donald Trump's policies who was hard on China. Therefore, C.I.A. management was protecting China from solid analysis. It's astonishing, but take it one step further. Remember who owns the Cloud on which all of the C.I.A.'s information is collected? And that's Jeff Bezos, who is China's number one distributor in the United States. CARLSON: In 10 seconds, does it shock you that the new Defense Secretary has basically said the greatest threat we face is not China, but white supremacists in this country? SMITH: No, not at all. If you look at the Biden administration, the way it's staffed, and unfortunately, if you look at the first family, you see that there are deep and extensive ties to the Chinese Communist Party. It doesn't surprise me at all. CARLSON: Amazing piece. Lee, I appreciate your coming on tonight. SMITH: Thank you very much, Tucker. Thanks. CARLSON: Thank you very much. We'll be back tomorrow night 8:00 p.m., the show that's the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. Sean Hannity takes over from New York now. Classification"
2021-02-24,"TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening, and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. Have you ever noticed how nobody in Washington can agree on a number? Now math is supposed to be objective except in Oregon where it is racist. But in the real world, you would think that people with functioning calculators could come to similar math based conclusions once in a while, but not in D.C. Try getting a consensus on unemployment projections or consumer confidence levels from Members of Congress. You can't even get a straight answer on how many troops will be occupying the Capitol three months from now and that's something they directly control. Even allowing for the fact that most politicians aren't capable of math, it is striking. Statistics turn out to be a lot sloppier than they look. So with all of that in mind, it's pretty amazing to watch virtually everyone in Washington -- Republican and Democrat -- repeat precisely the same number on one of the most critical problems that we face, and that number is 11 million. That number they tell us is exactly how many foreign nationals currently live here illegally. All the experts say that. There are precisely 11 million undocumented aliens. Now 11 million is a lot. On the other hand, at a time of trillion dollar spending bills, is it really so many? Eleven million isn't what it used to be. In any case, that's exactly how many illegal aliens there are, 11 million, 11 million, 11 million. No more, no less. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Of the 250 million undocumented people in the world today, the United States has 11 million. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The 11 million undocumented immigrants already paid taxes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: To those, a lot of the 11 million people we're talking about. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right. I'm deporting 11 million people. Is that what we want to do? Is that the solution? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Eleven million undocumented people. CARLSON: Okay, okay. Only 11 million. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is America, we're not going to go round up 11 million people. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The undocumented population has remained stable at about 11 million for the last half a decade. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Negatively impacting not just 11 million people. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have 11 million people here who are undocumented. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: As an undocumented immigrant in this country, one of 11 million who are viewed as criminals. CARLSON: It's almost like a script. Now people have different views on what we've got to do about illegal immigrants, but nobody questions how many there are because there are 11 million. Period. Joe Biden knows this. He checked with a doctor he lives with. Dr. Jill Biden isn't a practicing physician, we established that, after doing a little shoe leather reporting with our sources in the medical community. But Dr. Jill isn't noted an internationally regarded academic researcher who once wrote a tripled space thesis on Community Colleges in Delaware, so she knows precisely how many undocumented future Americans live here. It is 11 million, she passed on her findings to Joe. JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Within a hundred days, I'm going to send to the United States Congress, a pathway to citizenship for over 11 million undocumented people. And all of those so-called DREAMers, those DACA kids, they're going to be immediately certified again, to be able to stay in this country and put on a path to citizenship. CARLSON: Now that tape was shot a month before the November election, Joe Biden then promised to turn 11 million undocumented people, DREAMers, people with big dreams into American citizens by giving them amnesty. And not long after that, by giving them absentee ballots. It was a big promise, but Joe Biden is in the White House. Now his party controls everything. So he can make good on that promise and he plans to do so. In fact, it's one of the very first things he is doing. How is it going to affect you? Well, according to Joe Biden's flak, it means you'll have exactly 11 million new fellow Americans. JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Certainly, as part of the proposal that the President outlined and proposed on day one is an earned path to citizenship, right, for 11 million immigrants who are undocumented immigrants who are living in the country. CARLSON: So it's an earned path to citizenship, no big deal. They earned it, every bit of it. Presumably, by mocking the laws of the country they'll now have a role in running. But actually, it is kind of a big deal. Adding 11 million new citizens would have big effects on America, profound effects. How many people is 11 million people? Well, 43 of the 50 U.S. states have a smaller population than 11 million. That's not just Wyoming and South Dakota. It's Virginia, Georgia, Michigan, New Jersey, Massachusetts and so on, big states. What would this cost? No one asked. It's kind of hard to know the real answer. But if you're trying to put the math together, be sure to factor in the free healthcare, you'll shouldn't be paying for every one of the 11 million. JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR: Do you support giving universal healthcare, Medicare-for-All to people who are in this country illegally? KAMALA HARRIS (D), VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Let me just be very clear about this. I am opposed to any policy that would deny in our country, any human being from access to public safety, public education or public health. Period. CARLSON: Now, it doesn't take an economist to know that giving free quote, ""healthcare"" which obviously will include gender transitions, by the way, to 11 million new people can easily capsize the entire U.S. economy very easily. As Milton Friedman once wisely noted, you can have a welfare state or you can have open borders, but you cannot have both. Yet we're getting both. But we may, in fact, be getting a great deal more than that, and that's the purpose of the segment tonight. We all assume that 11 million is the real number. But is it the real number? Is that actually the number of foreign nationals who live within our borders illegally and will be getting amnesty very soon? No, it's not the real number. In fact, it's a totally fake number, which people endlessly repeat only because they are badly informed or dishonest. They've been repeating that number for a very long time, more than 15 years, at least. Way back in 2005, the Pew Research Center announced that quote, ""The undocumented population has reached nearly 11 million."" The weird thing is that 12 years later, Pew had roughly the same estimate. Nothing had changed in more than a decade and that should have been a-tell that the number itself was fraudulent. In 2018, the Department of Homeland Security which exists to track numbers like these, played along with it and put the number of illegal aliens in the U.S. at somewhere around 12 million. Right? They just made that up. Watch our interview from April of 2019 with the then head of the Department of Homeland Security, Kirstjen Nielsen. When pushed, Nielsen conceded that actually, she didn't know the real number. She had no idea. CARLSON: Does the U.S. government know exactly how many people are living in this country illegally? I've seen academic studies that put that number between 11 million, 22 million, maybe more. What is the real number? KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, FORMER SECRETARY OF DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY: Yes. We debate it. I think that's accurate. CARLSON: So we don't know. NIELSEN: We do not know. No. CARLSON: That must be a grave concern to you that we potentially have more than 10 million people here whose identities we don't know, it could be over 20, whose identities we don't know. And like they could be anybody? NIELSEN: Yes. CARLSON: And so why is that not the single most pressing problem the country has? NIELSEN: In my opinion, right now, this is one of, if not the biggest crisis this country has faced in a decade. CARLSON: Okay, so we don't know. The question is, what is the real number? And why is everyone saying it is 11 million? Why is everyone coming to the same wrong conclusion? They're not all lying. So we checked and here's what we found. Pretty much everybody who talks about immigration, including Dr. Jill Biden is using the Census Bureau's Annual American Community Survey to estimate how many illegal immigrants live in this country. One senior lecturer at M.I.T. School of Management put it this way. ""It's been the only method used for the last three decades."" So what is the method? Well, the Census tallies up the number of foreign born people they've identified who live in this country, then estimate or subtract the number of foreign born people known to be in the U.S. legally. Bingo 11 million. That's what you get. The problem is, this method of calculation is bound to be wrong. Many illegal immigrants don't respond to census takers, why would they? They're here illegally. Robert Groves, the former Director of the Census Bureau summed up the reality this way, quote, ""There's no magic bullet that anyone has discovered to count this population. This is really very difficult to estimate."" Oh, so many of the studies projected that there are only 11 million illegal immigrants have in fact acknowledged that the census is not perfect. They've been honest about that. But strangely, they assumed that it was pretty close to perfect. Specifically, they operated on the assumption that only about 10 percent of illegal immigrants weren't being captured by census takers, weren't responding to the forms. Put another way, their models assumed that 90 percent of the people living in this country illegally were willing to cooperate with census takers. Now why would they assume that? That seems like a ridiculous assumption, but there's a reason. Ann Coulter explains that reason in her book, ""Adios, America,"" which even now is one of the few serious explorations of this topic, assuming it's not now banned by Amazon, which it may be. It turns out that researchers have been relying on a 2001 study, 20 years ago, funded by the University of California. That survey surveyed a total of 829 people born in Mexico and living in Los Angeles, and asked them whether they responded to census interviews. Now, the majority of them said yes, but here's the amazing thing. Nearly 40 percent of those households refuse to answer the survey, at all. In other words, all the assumptions that there are 11 million illegal immigrants in this country are based on a separate asylum and it's that 90 percent of illegal immigrants are willing to cooperate with the Census Bureau, and that assumption itself is based on a survey showing nearly half of all illegal immigrants refuse to fill out the survey. This is bad math at the very least. In 2018, researchers at Yale and M.I.T. decided to update the methodology, yes, not a minute too soon. They did not rely on census data. Instead, they used, quote, ""operational data"" such as deportations, visa overstays, demographic data, death rates, immigration rates, et cetera. Those are real numbers. They combined them and used a mathematical model to establish a range of estimates. How many people live here illegally? Here's what they found, quote, ""After running one million simulations of the model, the researchers' 95 percent probability range is 16 million to 29 million illegal aliens with 22.1 million as the mean."" In other words, the estimates that we've been relying on for decades and repeating to each other like they are real, the estimates the Biden administration is now using to justify mass amnesty could possibly in fact, may likely be off by more than 18 million people. There could easily be 30 million illegal immigrants living in this country or more. How many people is that? That's more people that live in the entire State of Texas. So how would amnesty for that many people affect our, quote, ""democracy,"" one we're also worried about? In effect, it would end our democracy. People who have lived here all of their lives, paid taxes, followed the rules, have been good citizens would find their votes diluted to the point of irrelevance. By the way, it would mean an instantaneous end to African-American political power. That would be over for good, no question about it. Apparently, Maxine Waters is too dumb to know it, but that would be the effect. Of course, it would also ensure permanent rule by the Democratic Party, which is the point of it. We should tell you that it's not just Yale and M.I.T. who have concluded the 11 million number is ridiculous. Back in 2005, Bear Stearns, the bank, of all places, reached the same conclusion. Bear Stearns estimated the total illegal immigrant population to be as high as 20 million. That was 16 years ago. Here was their top line finding in that study, quote, ""Our research has identified significant evidence that the census estimates of undocumented immigrants may be capturing as little as half of the total undocumented population. This gross undercounting is a serious accounting issue, which could ultimately lead to government policy errors in the future."" Oh, you think? Like giving amnesty to 11 million who are actually 30 million? Yes, that could be an error. Now, to make this calculation, Bear Stearns did not rely on census data because they are a bank, they're not as dumb as our government. Instead, they looked at bank transfers, remittances from the U.S. to Mexico. They wanted to capture the number of payments from illegal aliens living here to their families back home and here is what they found. Quote, ""The rate of increase in remittances far exceeds the increases in Mexicans residing in the U.S. and their wage growth. Between 1995 and 2003, the official tally of Mexicans has climbed 56 percent. The median weekly wage income has increased by 10 percent. Yet total remittances jumped 199 percent over the same period."" How did that happen? Well, there was no obvious explanation for this disparity apart from a lot more illegal immigration than the authorities were acknowledging. And then researchers at Bear Stearns looked at other indicators. For example, they analyzed data on school enrollment and housing permit applications for multiple dwellings. In one instance, they found that some towns in New Jersey reported a five or six percent growth in population size, at the very same time that requests for housing permits were increasing by 600 percent. What? Quote, ""In major immigrant gateway cities, the influx of immigrants has led to overcrowded dwellings and a housing boom, unexplained by official population growth."" Happening all across the country, our authorities don't know or intentionally ignore it, or they lie to us about it. Again, that was all 16 years ago. And now in 2021, the party in charge is still assuring us that the number of illegal immigrants in this country has somehow declined by up to 10 million people. Could that be true? How insulting is that? Even to float that idea? Consider everything that has happened since 2006. The amnesty for the so- called DREAMers, the promises of mass amnesty, the endless caravan. So the 11 million number is above all a lie. The 11 million number is one of the more obvious lies ever told. We're a TV show. We're not social scientists and it took about an hour to find this out. It's a ridiculous lie. On some level, Joe Biden knows this. In the summer of 2019, he had more or less admitted that the point of amnesty he suggested is not just to give citizenship to 11 million people. The point is to import as many new Democratic voters as possible and there's no limit. Watch. BIDEN: We could afford to take in a heartbeat another two million people. The idea that a country of 330 million people cannot absorb people who are in desperate need, and who are justifiably fleeing oppression is absolutely bizarre. Absolutely bizarre. I would also move to increase the total number of immigrants able to come to the United States. CARLSON: He's just throwing numbers out there. They all are. They don't know the real number. They're hiding what they do know. They're cloaking the obvious beneath more slogans. Consider how unbelievably irresponsible it is for a policymaker, and now, the Vice President of the United States just throw out there, yes, we'll cover free healthcare for everyone here illegally without even knowing how many people that is. That's insane. Who would do something like that? How do you feel about the country you would do that to? You'd have contempt for it. Of course, they won't tell you the total number. They want you to believe it is 11 million always and forever. And by the time you figure out they are lying to you, it will be too late to do anything about it, obviously. Mark Morgan previously ran I.C.E., C.B.P. and the Border Patrol. He joins us tonight. Mr. Morgan, I appreciate your coming on. MARK MORGAN, FORMER ACTING COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION: Thanks for having me. CARLSON: So it is just not to belabor this point, but it's remarkable to me. You know, the question of who lives in your country is the central question, and maybe you want more people or fewer people or you'd want to give amnesty or you don't. But to have these conversations without knowing what the baseline number is strikes me as like insane. MORGAN: Tucker, you're absolutely right. And you are one of the only people who is talking about it right now. Everything you just said is something we should all be thinking about. The 11 million is absolutely a lie. And look, whether it's through ignorance or intention, the people that are continuing to say that are aligned to the American people. Look, M.I.T. and Yale, you talked about the studies, they're not exactly known to be, you know, right-leaning conservative think tanks, and they've got the numbers you said between 16 and 29 million and that's even a wide gap. And one of the reasons -- let me give you just one stat. For the last 30 to 35 years, between 50,000 to 150,000 have gotten past us because our borders are not completely secure. That that factor alone is not -- look, I'm not going to do public math, but think about it. I mean, that's happening constantly as we speak right now. The other thing right now, it's not just about amnesty, it's about amnesty and open borders. So right now, they're encouraging and facilitating illegal immigration. They're not going to lawfully deport them. So in a couple years, we're going to have a few more million people that the Democrats will say, now, here's the next round of amnesty. And the last thing, Tucker, here's a secret that they don't want you to know about. The overwhelming majority of people that are illegally entering the country today, they don't care about a pathway to citizenship. Shocker. They don't care. What they care about is being allowed in the United States to be able to work illegally and prevented from being deported. This is an advocate Democratic push, because they believe, as you said, every person, illegal alien that they provide citizenship, they think that's going to be a Democratic vote. That's what's driving this. CARLSON: Of course, I mean, we will spend public funds in voter registration drives the second this happens. I just can't get over the fact that we don't know. In a country, they tell us constantly is a democracy or let's pretend that you know, preserve the democracy, preserve our norms. And yet, the average person has no idea. The average informed person has no idea what this will mean, because no one is saying it out loud. Don't we have a right to know what's coming? I mean, seriously, like a right to know. MORGAN: We do, Tucker. I agree, and that's one of the things that I saw from the U.S.G. is, is an inability. We have so many centers of different agencies that are collecting pieces of information and data. We need to get together. Like example, we need to know each year how many people have we estimated that illegally entered that we didn't catch? We can estimate that with some fidelity. We need to know how many visa overstays there are, a different agency department does that. We need to know how many people are here under every other single program. We can do this. CARLSON: If you care about your family, you'd like one home with people living in your house. You know, they just don't care about the country, obviously, obviously. Mark Morgan, it's great to see you. Thank you for that. MORGAN: You bet. CARLSON: So the Governor of New York won an Emmy, we've mocked him endlessly, but we have to concede, he is pretty entertaining. There's a new Andrew Cuomo scandal tonight, we are proud to report. This time strip poker is involved. We've got the evidence. Also, our new series of documentaries ""Tucker Carlson Originals"" coming soon on FOX Nation. Tonight, we have a brand new trailer to share from one of the episodes, which focus on the once Great City of Chicago and what is happening there now. CARLSON: Oh, we're digging into the Andrew Cuomo file again. I've got to admit, we're enjoying it. Here's the latest, an aide to Cuomo revealed earlier this month that New York was hiding nursing home data from the public. Now another Cuomo aide, one who is not in prison has come out with a new allegation. FOX's Trace Gallagher has the story for us tonight. Hey Trace. TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Hey Tucker, Lindsey Boylan is the former special adviser to Governor Andrew Cuomo, as well as former Deputy Secretary for Economic Development. She says the Governor has kissed her on lips, gone out of his way to touch her on the lower back, arms and legs and once smirked as he showed her a cigar box and talked about the affair between former President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky. Boylan also claims during a plane flight in October of 2017, the New York Governor suggested they play strip poker. Quoting, ""Governor Andrew Cuomo has created a culture within his administration where sexual harassment and bullying is so pervasive that it is not only condoned, but expected."" Cuomo and his aides say Boylan is lying, a stark contrast to when Cuomo said unlike the Trump administration, he will always believe the woman. Watch. GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): And all they got was a deaf ear from President Trump and Washington, but New York passed the strongest sexual harassment law in the United States of America. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] GALLAGHER: The very same Governor, mind you, who during the confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh said quoting again, ""To Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and all survivors of sexual assault, we believe you and we will fight for you."" Lindsey Boylan says two other women have also reached out to her to share their own sexual harassment experiences involving Governor Cuomo -- Tucker. CARLSON: Amazing. Trace Gallagher, thank you. Well, it really is ""The Sopranos"" over there. But on a more serious note, any man who brags about what a feminist he is, keep your daughters away from that guy, just as a rule. Well, for some reason back in Washington, our media still believe Anthony Fauci has moral authority and understands science. So they're asking permission to do basic things that every American we thought had a right to do: going outside, hugging family members. In interview on Sunday, for example, Fauci was asked whether the coronavirus vaccine means that grandparents could finally see their grandchildren again. Here's how he responded, quote: ""I don't want to be making a recommendation now on public TV."" Why did he say that? Why are we still listening to him? Dr. Marc Siegel joins us to assess. Doctor, thanks so much for coming on. You know the vaccine in the minds of a lot of people, we talk about this a ton on the show, had so much promise it was going to mean that, you know, life could return to normal. Now, it seems like it doesn't mean anything or am I misreading this? DR. MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR: You're not misreading that. The goalposts are being moved, and I'll say right at the start here that I think that the vaccine is a ticket to seeing grandma and mom all over again. But let me start on a lighter note Tucker, Reykjavik, Iceland. Hooray for Reykjavik because you know why? They're letting travelers there with this vaccine passport now. Hooray. No testing, no quarantining. The vaccine passport. Now you're going to say to me, instead, oh, the winner, Doc, it is 30 degrees there. CARLSON: I am just going to say, I am not getting a passport. Sorry, excuse me. SIEGEL: It's gorgeous there. CARLSON: Yes. SIEGEL: Last night, I went to Madison Square Garden, and you know what? It was muted and there was hardly a hotdog in sight. You know, the worst thing about it, Tucker, I couldn't use my vaccine passport to get in. They made me do a test, and I'm thinking to myself, this is the poor messaging from the government again, because Tucker, the vaccine itself is 95 percent effective, but the testing, maybe 60 or 70 percent. How does that make any sense? Now, on a more serious note, I want to talk about the people out there so many of them that have lost loved ones over the last year that didn't get to visit them in a hospital, that didn't get to see them in a nursing home, that couldn't even have a proper funeral. Now, hooray, we're supposed to wake up and have a vaccine and the vaccine is supposed to allow us to visit our loved ones we haven't seen and I want to announce on this show that next weekend, I am traveling to Detroit to see my mother-in-law for her 80th birthday. She has multiple sclerosis. She's bedbound, Tucker. She can hardly move. One of her few pleasures in life is to see her daughter and me and we're going there with our vaccine proudly. And you know what the problem is here, Tucker? It comes down to something you are going to agree with, which is we have no incentives, right? It's all about protect yourself, protect society, abstract words. We need incentives. Here's your vaccine, go into a gym. Here's your vaccine, you can go see grandma. Here's your vaccine, go to Reykjavik on a discount plane fare and see the Northern Lights, Tucker. CARLSON: Sounds pretty great. Dr. Siegel, great to see you. Thank you. SIEGEL: Thank you, Tucker. CARLSON: Getting tested before going into Madison Square Garden, one of the world's filthiest buildings. Have you seen land prices in rural Montana recently? Pretty high. I wonder why? Well, next up, AT&T is the largest telecommunications company in the world, a very powerful company. It's also the parent company of CNN. We're learning tonight that AT&T and its CEO, John Stankey have another role, lobbying on behalf of the Communist Party of China. We'll tell you exactly what happened after the break. CARLSON: AT&T, it's one of the most powerful conglomerates in the world, it is the largest telecommunications company on the globe. It's also not, incidentally the parent company of CNN. That means a massive amount of America's digital infrastructure depends on CNN, a massive amount. If AT&T and its CEO, John Stankey decided to prioritize foreign interests over American interests that would be grave news to every American. We're learning tonight that in at least one instance, that's exactly what AT&T and John Stankey did. We've confirmed that AT&T lobbied the Department of Commerce not to levy sanctions against China Telecom, which is a large state owned corporation headquartered in Beijing. This is first reported by the ""National File."" Specifically, we note that AT&T worked to keep China Telecom off of something called ""The Entity List."" That list blocks companies from selling American products and technology to certain foreign firms without first getting a license. We're told that China Telecom was set to be sanctioned because of its alleged support of human rights abuses by China's government and there are very many of those. U.S. officials have said that China Telecom is backed by the Chinese Military and under control of the nation's Communist Party, and of course that makes sense. AT&T is a proud partner of China Telecom. It has a joint venture with China Telecom. In a statement provided to this show, AT&T admitted that it does not want China Telecom on the entities list, setting potential unintended consequences. Corey Stewart is the former Undersecretary of Commerce for Industry and Security, he has firsthand knowledge of what happened and he joins us tonight to explain. Corey Stewart, I appreciate your coming on tonight. COREY STEWART, FORMER UNDERSECRETARY OF COMMERCE FOR INDUSTRY AND SECURITY: Thanks for having me. CARLSON: It's hard to believe that AT&T, an American -- you think of it as an American company would lobby on behalf of a company controlled by the Chinese Military. Tell us, if you would, what you know about this, and why it happened? STEWART: Well, you know, as I was undersecretary, it was very disturbing because we had a lot of indications. There's very good Intelligence out there that the Chinese government through its basically state-owned subsidiary of China Telecom has been using cell phone technology, telecommunications technology to track minority populations in China, to spy on them, and then to hand this information over to the China Police State. And they are rounding up the Uighur population, which is a minority Muslim group in Western China, as well as Tibetans and other minorities, placing these people in essentially modern day concentration camps, where there's widespread reports of gang rapes, of torture, other human rights abuses, potentially even executions and genocide occurring in these camps. And China Telecom was assisting the government of China and helping to do that. When we learned of this we, of course, in the Trump administration began to place China Telecom on the entity list to put sanctions upon them when we were contacted by Ed Gillespie, the Executive Vice President of AT&T, who urged us not to place China Telecom despite these abuses on the entity list. And needless to say, we were pretty much shocked by that. CARLSON: Why would John Stankey, the CEO of the company, I mean, AT&T has a lot of different businesses. It's a very successful company. It is a critical company in the United States. Why would he jeopardize the image of AT&T by siding with a company that is -- had a hand in genocide in China? It doesn't make sense to me. STEWART: It doesn't make sense, unless you assume that despite what CNN and its corporate parents say about protecting minorities and standing up for human rights, it's all a lie. And what they're actually doing is placing profit over and above human rights, over and above U.S. national security concerns. And, you know, I have to say that AT&T is not alone. There are other U.S. corporations in China who are turning a blind eye to the human rights abuses, who are turning a blind eye to China threatening its neighbors in the South China Sea, who are turning a blind eye to what they're doing is helping China undermine U.S. national security concerns. And that is something that we tried in the Trump administration, and we were on the verge of placing China Telecom, as well as all the companies on that entity list, and let me just say this. The staff, the career staff at the Commerce Department were clearly on a path to do this. If it doesn't happen, that will mean that there was pressure from the Biden administration put on it by AT&T to not put them on there. CARLSON: I look forward to CNN covering the story in some detail given the often expressed concern for human rights. Undersecretary Stewart, I appreciate your coming on tonight. Thank you. STEWART: Thank you. CARLSON: Well, the Equality Act may soon become law. Of course, that means we're all equal now. You think you may be a man or a woman, but those sexist terms, Biology itself will soon be a thing of the past. You should know what's coming and we will tell you after the break. CARLSON: Well, the House of Representatives is preparing to vote on something called the Equality Act, which sounds like something out of a Kurt Vonnegut short story, but it's not, it's totally real. And we know this will not shock you. It has nothing to do with equality which we already are guaranteed in our founding documents. It's something very different. Harmeet Dhillon knows what it is. She's a Civil Rights attorney. She's here to break down what this act will mean. Harmeet, I appreciate your coming on tonight. So the Equality Act, everything is Orwell, is that -- is this about equality? HARMEET DHILLON, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY: It would better be named the women's cancellation act because it looks like cancel culture has finally come for the female gender, Tucker. What we're seeing in this act is basically a denial of science. This is the flat Earthers taking control of the government and using those levers of power to elevate the rights of transgender women, people who are born as men over the rights of biological women. And it's not just conservatives who are concerned about this, Tucker. It is also a school of feminists because women have fought for many years in our courts and through our government to ensure equality in pay, and in promotion, and in just about everything else. But what this law does is it takes the recent decision of the Supreme Court in the Bostock case, which gave equal access regarding gender identification in the employment context, and it spreads it to just about everything else. So now, if this law passes, Congress will mandate that just about every business in the United States, but including shelters and other facilities where needy people are housed together, are going to be forced to ignore gender and have gender identity as the norm by which people will enjoy benefits. And so for example, at a nail salon or at a waxing salon, businesses will be forced to wax people's genitalia, regardless of the gender that the operator of that business prefers to deal with, which of course discriminates against women who choose to do business with other women. And so why do we need this law? We need this law because there is this religion of destruction of these norms, including science, but also including religion. This law will actually abrogate the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which we were assured just two years ago would not be threatened when this gender identity was expanded to employment. We were told, oh, don't worry, it's not going to be expanded to churches or other houses of worship. Well, this law explicitly says that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which protects our rights and religious institutions to not have the government force on us these social norms that are inconsistent with our religious values. That's no defense to charges under these laws. This is very dangerous and it eliminates everything that women have stood for and our specialness and our personal experience as women, CARLSON: And there are billions at stake. Very quickly, if I own a construction company as a man, hard for me to get a Federal contract, obviously, but if it's a female owned construction company, there are set asides for me. What prevents me from saying I'm a woman now, tell me I'm not, I want the contract -- a serious question. DHILLON: That's exactly right and you're seeing this in sports, Martina Navratilova and others are complaining about the application of this law in sports and we're seeing that gaming of the system there. You are going to see women being replaced by men posing as women in every facet of our lives if this law becomes the law. CARLSON: I may open a construction company to seize those coveted road contracts. That will be a real thing. You watch. Harmeet Dhillon, I know you'll be at the center of it. Great to see you tonight. Thank you. DHILLON: Thank you, Tucker. CARLSON: So teachers unions have basically controlled our kids for decades. Now, nobody says anything about it because they are huge campaign donors. But that all ended a few days ago when the one and only Adam Carolla went to war with one of the biggest teachers unions in the country. Adam Carolla joins us next to explain what he did. CARLSON: So the teachers unions are just totally out of the closet, confirming everything we've suspected for years. They're not teaching just because their teachers, they'd rather be in Puerto Rico sipping margaritas. What happens to your kids? They could literally care less. They're saying it now. In Baltimore, one teachers union has decided that even responding to e- mails, it's just too much of a burden. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Starting Monday, most teachers in Howard County will carry out a work to rule protest. COLLEEN MORRIS, PRESIDENT, HOWARD COUNTY EDUCATION ASSOCIATION: Staff are finished sacrificing everything for an employer who has no respect for their lives or their work. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The work to rule resolution states that until teachers and staff are fully vaccinated, teachers will not respond to e-mails outside of their working hours. Substitute requests will not be honored when a teacher is out sick. Teachers won't be cleaning up after students and elementary school teachers will not provide coverage for lunch or recess duty. According to the C.D.C., Howard County falls into the moderate to low transmission category, which means they can move to full in-person instruction. CARLSON: How are the schools in Howard County, Maryland? Are they pretty good? Would you want to send your kids to one? Nobody even asked. Nobody even cares. Nobody says the obvious. Teachers unions are totally corrupt and entitled and actively hurting your kids. People don't say that because teachers unions give a ton of money to politicians -- to Democrats. But that changed this week, that cone of silence over teachers unions when Adam Carolla went to war with the L.A. Teachers Union on social media, quote, ""L.A. teachers either don't want to go back to work or are cowards."" He tweeted. ""Those are the only two options left."" And that struck a nerve over at the union where of course everyone was sitting at home on Twitter instead of teaching kids. The teachers union's Twitter account immediately fired back. They accused Carolla of cowardice, or as they put it, sitting safely in his La Canada Kenyatta mansion. Right? Okay. Adam Carolla is the host of ""The Adam Carolla Show."" He joins us tonight for an update on this pretty amazing exchange. So what led you to do this? Adam, thanks for coming on. What led you to go after the teachers union? ADAM CAROLLA, COMEDIAN AND AUTHOR: Well, I've got 14-year-old twins that have been sitting in their La Canada mansion rotting for the last year, and they're supposed to start high school and they've never started high school, and it's abundantly clear what's going on now. The people that tell you to follow the science are ignoring the science. So I just realized we're going to have to buck up. I mean, they are ice sculptures. They're not going anywhere. They are frozen. And we need to step up and people need to rise up and start telling these heroes to start doing their job again. CARLSON: It's just so striking to me how few have done what you did. I mean, these are children who are being destroyed -- literally destroyed. It's measurable, mental health, suicide, addiction. And yet, nobody does this. Like why did it fall to you to do this a year out? CAROLLA: Because I'm a hero, and everyone else is a coward. I don't know what's wrong with L.A., there's something wrong. I mean, there's something to it. First off, these teachers unions went to my advertisers and tried to cancel me. I have over 25 employees, none of them have missed a paycheck since COVID and the people who don't create any jobs whatsoever, just a bureaucracy go after my advertisers to try to get me out of a job, so I can then what? Not create any more jobs? It's cowardly. CARLSON: They've got a lot of time, I noticed to try and pull you off the air and respond to you on Twitter. I mean, shouldn't they be grading homework or something? Responding to grieving parents watching their kids degrade? CAROLLA: Agreed and here's a thought experiment. Remember six to seven months ago when we were saying, we're not going to have a vaccine for another two, maybe three, maybe five years? Well, the teachers won't go back into the classroom until they are vaccinated. But what if that vaccine was three years away? Would you just let the kids sit in their rooms and grow beards until you guys were vaccinated then? CARLSON: So disgusting. And I really appreciate -- I know a lot of parents appreciate you saying the obvious out loud, being brave enough to do it, taking the time from having a real job to engage with the teachers unions. Adam Carolla, thank you. We're rooting for you. CAROLLA: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: So much going on in this country. You just sort of wonder, is Joe Biden really capable of running this place? I hope so. We'll see. We'll be back tomorrow night and every week night, 8:00 p.m. The show that is the sworn and totally sincere enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. Now for the 9:00 p.m. hour. We never use this word, but we will tonight, the fabulous Sean Hannity. Classification"
2021-01-11,"TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. Within hours of the riot at the U.S. Capitol last week, in case you weren't watching, we denounced the violence we saw in the clearest possible terms. We did it for one reason. We are totally opposed to political violence. We said that virtually every night for the past six months since the riots began on Memorial Day. We meant it then, we mean it now. Every person who broke the law last Wednesday should be prosecuted. Vandalize a building, hurt a cop -- go to jail. That's our position. That has always been our position. This show is for law and order. Period. Many of those currently in power or not, they believe instead in selective enforcement. Selective enforcement is not law and order. It is the opposite. Laws must be applied equally to every citizen or else they are not laws, they are the whims of a tyrant. Punish the guilty, spare the innocent. That is the most basic definition of justice. But that is not what's happening now. The crackdown on civil liberties we've watched over the past five days amounts instead to collective punishment. People who had nothing to do with the violence in the U.S. Capitol are being punished for that violence, and that is repugnant and immoral and anti-American. It should shock our sensibilities. It shocks Alexey Navalny. Navalny is the Russian dissident who was poisoned last year apparently by the Putin government. He has watched the recent crackdown in this country by Joe Biden and his allies in Big Business and Big Tech with growing concern and then horror. Here's his conclusion, quote, ""We have seen many examples in Russia and in China of such private companies becoming the state's best friends and enablers when it comes to censorship. This precedent will be exploited by the enemies of freedom of speech around the world,"" end quote. So even in Russia, they know what's happening here is dangerous and it's wrong, because it is. In the past five days, PayPal, keep in mind, is supposed to be a payment processor, not a political party or a law enforcement agency. PayPal suspended the account of a group that paid for Trump supporters to travel to Washington last week. Now, it's not clear that any of these people participated in illegal acts. We do not know. But they were shut down anyway for their political views. It's not an isolated case, it's happening all over. It happened to performer Ariel Pink. Pink made the mistake of listening to the President's address on Wednesday. Pink says he didn't get anywhere near the Capitol, he went to his hotel and fell asleep and no one has suggested otherwise. But for the crime of attending a political rally, Pink was punished. He was promptly dropped from his record label. He is done. Now it's possible he might not be able to fly on airplanes. A flight attendants union has demanded banning all quote ""insurrectionists"" from flying commercially anywhere in the United States. So the question is, and everything hangs on this definition: what's an insurrectionist? Well, according to a letter from Democrats in Congress, it is anyone who sympathizes with what happened on Wednesday. Think about that. Now you can oppose what happened at the Capitol and for the 15th time, we do oppose it loudly have and will. And you can still see this development for what it is. It's terrifying lunacy. But no one is pushing back against it. Instead, the biggest corporations in this country, the ones that control your checking account, the ones that control your healthcare, whether you live or die, have decided to radically expand the definition of what is now illegal. Insurrection, according to this new definition means questioning any part of last November's election. So you thought that your birthright as an American was the right to ask questions, but not anymore. That's now a crime. Consider this among many examples. A total of 139 Republicans in the House of Representatives objected to the certification of Joe Biden's victory, they were joined by several Republicans in the Senate. They called instead for an audit of the election results. Here's what they didn't do. They did not urge anyone to commit violence. They did not support the people who stormed the Capitol Building. For our part, we did not promote their cause on this show. We had mixed feelings about it. On the other hand, we didn't denounce them as insurrectionist because they weren't and they aren't. Except now they are. And that definition has huge consequences, not just for them, but for the country. You'll notice the definition of insurrection has changed quite a bit in just four years. Here's what insurrection look like right after the 2016 election. REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL (D-WA): Mr. President, I object to the certificate from the State of Georgia on the grounds that the electoral votes were not -- JOE BIDEN (D), THEN VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: No debate. There is no debate. Section 15 and 17 of Title III of the United States Code requires that any objection be presented in writing and signed by both a member of the House of Representatives and a senator. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mr. President, even as people waited hours in Georgia -- BIDEN: There is no debate. There is no debate if it is not signed by a senator, the objection cannot be entertained. CARLSON: Now, you may not remember that because not much happened in its aftermath. No major corporation threatened to destroy anyone for that insurrection. They've changed. In the past few days, BlueCross BlueShield, JPMorgan Chase, Marriott, Citigroup, Commerzbank, not small companies have all cut off donations to Republicans who objected in any way to this year's election results. Companies like Dow, AT&T, and Morgan Stanley announced today they will do the same. Here's how Citibank's Head of Global Affairs explained this move, quote, ""We want you to be assured that we will not support candidates who do not respect the rule of law."" Now that sounds like a brand new standard, of course it is. And by the way, it does not apply to any Democrat, and that's all of them who support flagrantly illegal sanctuary cities all over the country. Talk about an attack on the rule of law, but that doesn't count. ""Forbes"" Magazine, meanwhile, wants to make certain that no one who worked in the Trump administration will ever have a job again, quote, ""Let it be known to the business world,"" announced the magazine's editor, "" ... hire any of Trumps fellow fabulists and Forbes will assume that everything your company or firm talks about is a lie."" In other words, dare to hire someone from the presidential administration, that's many thousands of people and we will destroy your business. That's healthy and normal? You want your country to fall apart completely? Keep up fascist insanity like that, because it definitely will. The irony, of course, is that the Biden era which you probably didn't welcome was, at the very least supposed to be a return to normal. That was the upside. But it turns out this is the new normal: silencing, blacklists, social credit scores, threats. It's almost boring at this point to point out the steaming hypocrisy in all of this and we'll stop after tonight. But just for the record, we can't resist. Six months after Donald Trump's election, Nancy Pelosi wrote this on Twitter quote, ""Our election was hijacked. There was no question. Congress has a duty to #ProtectOurDemocracy and #FollowTheFacts."" Insurrection? No. A month later, a Bernie Sanders voter tried to murder congressional Republicans, officeholders with a rifle at a baseball practice in Arlington, Virginia. He almost succeeded he shot Steve Scalise and almost killed him. Yet none of these same corporations, these morally aware corporations suspended donations to Bernie Sanders or to Nancy Pelosi and by the way, shouldn't have because Pelosi and Sanders didn't pull the trigger. But they didn't even consider it, nor did they issue statements about respecting the rule of law are threatened Nancy Pelosi's fabulists with never working again in America. These same companies indeed remained quiet all last summer after BLM set fire to the ancient Episcopal Church in front of the White House and then drove the President of the United States into an underground bunker with violence. They said nothing. They said nothing when rioters destroyed a police precinct in Minneapolis. In fact, the whole downtown of that city when they besieged a Federal Courthouse in Portland, Oregon, or established their own country, a breakaway republican downtown Seattle and shot a guy in the middle of it. That's not entirely true. They didn't comment on it, in some ways they approved it. Citibank three months later gave the rioters money. Citi created a $1 billion fund for racial equity. Go ahead and define that term. Some enterprising progressives established something called the Minnesota Freedom Fund that raised tens of millions of dollars to bail out the violent rioters, the insurrectionists. Big Tech and Democratic Party politicians including Kamala Harris supported that fund of the insurrectionists, they supported them. We were against that kind of crap then, we're completely against it now. But from their perspective, violence and insurrection are not necessarily bad. It's a situational, a kind of situational ethics -- you remember that from the 60s. So when our side does it, it's a good thing because the arc of justice is long. But when the other side does it, we unleash the F.B.I. to conduct one of the biggest manhunts in recent history. So we're all Roger Stone now, everyone on the wrong side of that equation. But actually, it's worse than that if we're going to be honest, and we don't want to be alarmists, but the hair on your arms is already standing up, because you can feel that this is bad, because it is. Something bigger is happening here, something we've never seen in the full course of American history. Corporations, which are now more powerful than they have ever been, ever, are colluding with one another and with the political class to silence any opposition, not to some ideal. They don't have those, but to their rule. This is not what we were promised. The election is over. You thought things would calm down. Again, even if you voted against Joe Biden. You thought they would calm down. No chance. That's one campaign promise they didn't intend to keep. Why? Because calm doesn't serve their purposes. Most people -- most normal people in this country would like a placid political environment, but they don't benefit from them because their coalition has nothing in common with one another. They need an enemy to unite them. Period. And so they're going to keep torqueing up the pressure. How much pressure can our society take before it breaks? They may find out. Here's the President-elect, Mr. Unity, comparing his opponents in the Senate to Nazis. JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: They are part of the big lie -- the big lie. I was being reminded by a friend of mine, maybe you were with me, I can't recall when we were told that you know Goebbels and the great lie, you keep repeating the line repeating the lie. CARLSON: Not even pronouncing the name correctly, of course, but the broader point is, how dare you talk like that? You're the President-elect and you're comparing people who disagree with you or have questions about the campaign or oppose your agenda to Nazis? What's your message? They're not human. They're Nazis. You play with fire when you talk like that. People are going to get hurt if we keep this up. Nancy Pelosi plans to keep it up. Nancy Pelosi is not calling for unity. She doesn't want unity. Instead, she is leveling the most divisive attack you can make, and that's a racial attack. The real problem with Trump voters she explained the other day is the color of their skin. Listen. REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): There are people in our country led by this President, for the moment who have you chosen their whiteness of a democracy. CARLSON: That tape should live forever. When Donald Trump said yes, people should go to the Capitol, we thought that was reckless, and we said so. Because we want to be Americans, and responsible before anything else. So we were honest about that. Nancy Pelosi just attacked people who oppose her agenda for the color of their skin, their whiteness. What the hell does that mean? What does talk like that do to our country? What it does is send a very clear message: anyone who disagrees with Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi is a Nazi or a white supremacist or just white, which is the same thing. They're not Americans. They don't have human rights. They have no right to speak or to fly or to use banks or to hold jobs. Where is this going thinking like that? It's poison. We will tell you where it's going. It's going wherever Corporate America wants it to go because they're in charge effectively. Corporations are fully aligned. This has never happened in our country. They are fully aligned with a political party. How much distance between the Biden campaign and Google, the most powerful company in the world? Right around none. So publicly held multinationals like Facebook and Twitter and Google can do whatever they want and what they want to do is become partisan actors. They've silenced Donald Trump, okay. They will silence you if you dare dissent. Make no mistake. Republicans should have seen this coming. It's not like it was a mystery. Democrats never hid their intent. Here's Kamala Harris saying it out loud from a debate stage. KAMALA HARRIS (D), VICE PRESIDENT ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: Senator Warren, I just want to say that I was surprised to hear that you did not agree with me that on this subject of what should be the rules around corporate responsibility for these Big Tech companies, when I called on Twitter to suspend Donald Trump's account that you did not agree. And I would, I would urge you to join me. SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA): So look, I don't just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter, I want to push him out of the White House. That's our job. HARRIS: Join me and join me in saying that his Twitter account should be shut down. WARREN: Let's -- CARLSON: Anyone who says the other side must be forced to stop talking is a threat to our freedoms. Period. If you don't like what someone says, explain why and win people over voluntarily. That's what the democratic system is at its core. Anyone who says I will use the power of the state of Google to make the other side shut up again is a threat to your freedom. By the way, this is also illegal, baldly illegal. The coordination between these companies violates the most basic tenet of antitrust law. When monopolies conspire to suppress competition and hurt consumers, it is not even a close call, they are breaking the law. Period. And it doesn't matter if no one in Washington is brave enough to say that out loud, it doesn't make it less true, and that's exactly what they're doing and the evidence mounts. This weekend, Amazon Facebook, Google and Apple, openly coordinated set their sights on the social media app, Parler and booted it off the internet, and not just them. According to CEO of Parler, John Matze, quote, ""Every vendor from text message services to e-mail providers to our lawyers ditched us on the same day."" Whoa, imagine that. You wake up and you're suddenly unpopular with the wrong person and you can't communicate and you have no legal representation and you can't fly in an airplane and you can't put your money in a bank. On what g rounds did they do this to Parler? What did Parler do wrong? Well, we still don't know. No one has bothered to explain that. Not one person in law enforcement or the media has shown any connection between any of the criminals caught on camera at the Capitol Building -- you've seen them -- and Parler. Parler committed no crimes. So why are they gone? Well, conservatives speak to each other on Parler and that's dangerous. So they were banned. Yesterday, the left shut Parler down. They did it in a lot of different ways. But here's the way that you should think about most deeply. Amazon, the biggest retailer in the world also controls the largest collection of servers in the world. It is called Amazon Web Services. Now a huge percentage of the internet flows through Amazon servers, and that means everything both good and bad. Digital Mozart recordings, and hardcore pornography, Bible verses and invoices for illegal shipments of fentanyl, all of that, and much more. In fact, almost everything is hosted on Amazon servers. So until yesterday, no one imagined that Jeff Bezos could decide who gets to speak on the internet. That's too much power for one man. No, can we agree? We thought the left would agree, they don't. No one thought that Jeff Bezos could silence an entire political movement in an instant, simply because he thought they were expressing inconvenient views. But last night, that's exactly what Jeff Bezos did, and Parler went dark. Whoa, what's next? You will likely find out soon. John Matze is the CEO of Parler. We're happy to have him on the show tonight. John, thanks so much for coming on. I have to start at the end and ask you, since you built this application as a kind of safe space for freedom of speech, did you ever imagine that Amazon Web Services could or would shutting down in an instant? JOHN MATZE, CEO, PARLER: Thank you for having me on. I've theorized about it. You know, we've definitely theorized about it. You just never think it'll happen, though, right, you know? And what's really interesting is that they all did it on the same day -- those three -- without any prior warning. We woke up on Friday thinking business -- well not that -- it is never business as usual in Parler, but at least as close to usual as possible. We were number one on the App Store. You know, we had seven million -- almost seven million unique people on the app that day. And we get a notice, you know, you're in violation of our terms, one after another. But we found out first, in some cases, not from the companies, but from BuzzFeed. You know, we didn't get a notice from Google. We read it online in the news first. And that is shocking. And then after they set that example, you know, we get an e-mail after e-mail. You know, it's almost like you're just waiting, who is going to be next dumping us -- everybody. The last thing we have right now is e-mail, and I bet you within 24 hours, our e-mail will be shut off, too. CARLSON: I just have got to ask you, because I can't -- because I think this is a referendum on American society and where we are and where we're going. The left used to stand up for civil liberties. The famously moderate Joe Manchin approves of this, apart from Glenn Greenwald and Michael Tracey, God bless them both, I haven't seen any liberals stand up to say, wow, this is really scary. Have you? MATZE: I'm not sure. I mean, I've seen a lot of people say that this is scary, but I've also seen a lot of people who are participating in the five minutes of hate and kind of egging it on and cheering and it's disgusting. People threatening my life. I can't go home tonight. So there's -- this is really a lot. You know, this is not just, you know, our civil liberties. They can shut down a billion dollar company, half a billion to a billion dollar company -- that's what we were getting valuations at overnight. CARLSON: Are you going to be backup soon? MATZE: We will be backup eventually because we're not going to give up. But soon is difficult, you know. I thought immediately, oh, no problem. We'll call up a new vendor. Right? We call up the vendor, we're all good to go. And then right at the last second, sorry, somebody said something we can't host you by. And it's been that one after another ever since then. Right at the last minute, they just -- they just bail. So we're going to do it. We're going to be back online one day, and hopefully soon, as soon as possible. But this is a real challenge. We have to build our own infrastructure, our own everything in order to do it. CARLSON: Pirate radio, digital pirate radio, dark web. I hope so. I hope, John, you'll come back. You will come back with a list of every corporate coward who bowed to pressure to silence you and seven million other people on Parler. Those people deserve to be listened to. Amen. MATZE: You can bet I will, and there are almost 20 million people now, almost 20 million and yes, I will. CARLSON: I won't forget this day. Great to see you, John. Thank you. MATZE: Thank you. CARLSON: Well, Judge Jeanine Pirro is the host of ""Justice with Judge Jeanine"" on the FOX News Channel. She joins us with reaction tonight. Judge, thanks so much for coming on. So all of this is being done under the pretext that somehow everybody who voted for Trump or who is right of center who has questions about the election or doesn't like Joe Biden or thinks Google is too powerful, they are all implicated in the insurrection last week on Capitol Hill. And I couldn't resist noticing that you're -- you've got to one of the most prominent Trump supporters in the country, and you like immediately attacked that garbage, which you did. So what is this really about? JEANINE PIRRO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST, JUSTICE WITH JUDGE JEANINE: Well, look, what's happening in this country is beyond the pale, but I did, I said that what happened on Capitol Hill on January 6th was reprehensible. It was disgusting. CARLSON: Yes. PIRRO: It was criminal and that they need to be prosecuted for this. Without a doubt, the law is the law. We live in a civilized orderly society, they cannot do that. And they are no better than people who are committing other crimes all right, so take politics out of it. That's number one. But number two is the reaction that everyone is having to any Trump supporter and that's where the problem is. You've got 75 million Americans who voted for Donald Trump. Donald Trump has been taken off of Twitter. He is basically being de-platformed. But what they're doing is they've got this broad brush going against all of us. So wherever any conservative or Republican communicates, for example, on Parler, we're going to shut them down. We're not going to allow them to share their ideas on a platform of allegedly open ideas. And this is the punishment that we saw pre-election when big Tech Decided to suppress the Hunter Biden story. I don't know why we thought it would be any different after the election, except we thought that, gee, maybe Joe Biden will come in, that'll be the end of it. The President said the other day, I'm committed to a smooth and orderly transition of power, and Joe Biden says, I don't want to have any problems. Everything is great. And yet, we've got people focusing on an impeachment, on charging the President, on de-platforming all of us, on making sure that private -- so these big corporations don't contribute to republican politicians. This is the kind of thing that you see in a movie that can never happen in America and what we're giving these platforms just as an aside is immunity under 230. We're saying, go ahead. You know, you're a free platform open platform of ideas, but they are really editorializing. They're really publishing. CARLSON: That's right. PIRRO: So you know what? They should be held to that same standard. And you know, who's at fault for that? Congress. Congress has to pass a law to rip away that immunity that they are using to erase all of us, which is the most incredible thing. So now you've got 75 million Trump supporters who are saying, where am I going? What do I do now? Who do I follow? Can I say I supported Trump? CARLSON: Right. When you give control of your country to monsters like Jeff Bezos and Sundar Pichai, you know, this is when -- and Tim Cook at Apple -- this is what you get, I would say. Judge Jeanine, great to see you. PIRRO: Monsters. Thank you. CARLSON: We are learning tonight that one of Joe Biden's key appointees has a past that you will not believe. We rarely use the word shocking because it's overused. But we did some reporting in the last couple of days, and what we're going to tell you will shock you and it should. We'll be right back. KRISTEN CLARKE, NOMINEE FOR ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS DIVISION: If I'm fortunate enough to be confirmed, we will turn the page on hate and close the door on discrimination by enforcing our federal civil rights laws. CARLSON: That was a woman called Kristen Clarke speaking in an event last week for her new boss, President-elect Joe Biden. Kristen Clarke is Joe Biden's pick to run the Justice Department's enormously powerful Civil Rights Division. Clarke says her job is simple it's to end hate. But like so many in her world, Clarke is in fact an enthusiastic purveyor of what she claims to fight. Clarke has been on the show several times. A new investigation though by our reporters has uncovered shocking -- and we don't use that word lightly -- legitimately shocking statements that Clarke made in public while at Harvard. In 1994, Clarke wrote a letter to the ""Harvard Crimson"" in her capacity as the President of the Black Studies Association. Clarke wanted to explain her views on race science, quote, ""Please use the following theories and observations to assist you in your search for truth regarding the genetic differences between blacks and whites."" End quotes. You know, it's going to be interesting and it was, quote, ""One: Dr. Richard King reveals that the core of the human brain is the locus coeruleus, which is a structure that is black, because it contains large amounts of neuro melanin, which is essential for its operation."" ""Two: Black infants sit, crawl and walk sooner than whites. Three: Carol Barnes notes that human mental processes are controlled by melanin, that same chemical which gives blacks their superior physical and mental abilities. Four: some scientists have revealed that most whites are unable to produce melanin, because their pineal glands are often calcified, or non-functioning."" ""Pineal calcification rates with Africans are five to 15 percent, Asians 15 to 25 percent, and Europeans 60 to 80 percent. This is the chemical basis for the cultural differences between blacks and whites. And five: melanin endows blacks with greater mental, physical and spiritual abilities, something which cannot be measured based on Eurocentric standards,"" end quote. Let that sink in. Melanin endows black people with greater mental, physical and spiritual abilities. No, that's not an editorial from ""The Final Call,"" who is Farrakhan's free newspaper. That is a direct quote from the person Joe Biden is about to put in charge of this country's civil rights laws. Even at Harvard, crackpot theories like that were considered deranged and dangerous. After an outcry on campus, Kristen Clarke suggested that she didn't necessarily believe what she had written. Now the ""Harvard Crimson,"" a left-wing paper did not buy that explanation. ""Well, does she or doesn't she,"" wrote the editors. So far, she has given us every indication that she does, and indeed she did. Just a month later, Kristen Clarke invited the noted Trinidadian anti- Semite Tony Martin to speak on campus. Martin, then a professor at Wellesley College was the author of a self-published manifesto called ""The Jewish Onslaught."" In it Martin chronicled the, quote, ""escalating Jewish onslaught against black people."" Now for Martin's fans like Kristen Clarke, Martin's speech at Harvard did not disappoint. He attacked both Jews and Judaism as a religion. Tony Martin spent his final years giving speeches to Holocaust denial organizations on topics such as, quote, ""tactics of organized Jewry in suppressing free speech,"" end quote. Kristen Clarke strongly approved of Tony Martin and we're not speculating because as she told the ""Crimson"" after his speech, quote, ""Professor Martin is an intelligent, well-versed black intellectual who bases his information on indisputable fact."" So again, directly from Kristen Clarke, Tony Martin's anti-Semitism was based on quote, ""indisputable fact."" Kristen Clarke has never shed these views. They've simply become more sophisticated. Just last year, as a lawyer, Clarke was fighting for the crudest kind of racial discrimination in college admissions. This fall, she said it was quote, ""madness"" for the Federal government to take the side of Asian applicants who had provably been denied college admission purely because of their skin color. But tough luck. As far as Kristen Clarke was concerned, those Asians didn't have enough melanin, and melanin is the key. Speaking of madness in a same country, someone like Kristen Clarke would be under investigation by the Civil Rights Division, not running it. How crazy have we become? Well, we will see if Clarke's nomination gets to the U.S. Senate. And if it does, we're in serious trouble. Parler isn't the only tech company fighting back against this unprecedented moment. We will tell you about another major battle just getting started. It could change how you get information online. And of course, you get all your information online. So it's worth paying attention. We'll be right back. CARLSON: So the crackdown over the past five days has been without precedent, but not everyone caught up in it is taking it lightly. Parler is not the only tech company to file suit against Silicon Valley today. Just hours ago, the streaming service rumble.com sued Google in Federal Court. Rumble alleges that Google has been unfairly rigging its search algorithms. According to the lawsuit, Google has been able to quote, ""wrongfully divert massive traffic to YouTube,"" which of course, it owns. Chris Pavlovski is the CEO of rumble.com, and he joins us tonight. Chris, thanks so much for coming on. It sounds like what you're alleging is a pretty clear crime under antitrust law, is it not? CHRIS PAVLOVSKI, CEO, RUMBLE.COM: Tucker, thank you for having me on. So yes, in our complaint, what we're alleging is that Google is self- referencing YouTube in their search engine and they're also pre installing the YouTube app on all the Google devices, and specifically and uniquely within the complaint, and is very unique to us is that we were able to show that Google has redirected about 9.3 -- up to 9.3 billion visitors to YouTube instead of having it to Rumble. If those visitors had landed on rumble.com, we would have generated over a hundred million uploads on our platform, which would have resulted in damages well above in excess of $2 billion. But more importantly, who is getting affected here is not just Rumble, it is not just injury on Rumble right now. There's injury on over two million creators and even further than that, I was one of those guys that was building up websites out of my parents' basement, and it really saddens me because, imagine being a tech entrepreneur right now trying to build an online video platform. You absolutely do not have a shot. You don't have a chance. You have pre-installed YouTube apps on phones. You have a rigged search engine and you have no ability to compete in this market. And that's why our complaint is extremely important to fight back against these tech monopolies that are unfairly rigging it for all of us. CARLSON: Well, that's the argument against monopolies in the first place. They crush innovation, creativity, free thought, freedom itself. So Google clearly is a monopoly by any definition. Why do you suppose it has not been reined in? PAVLOVSKI: So you know, they've been -- it's interesting, because when YouTube was purchased by Google in 2006, late 2006, what we've noticed is that they've vertically -- well, it's my opinion that they vertically integrated YouTube with and into the search engine. And over time, they've continuously moved the goalposts over the last 15 years to make it more difficult over time for us, for companies like us to compete. And one of the things that like we allege in the complaint is, and we show is that if you search funny dogs on Rumble, you're going to get funny dogs on YouTube, which is crazy. When you think about that, if they can rig the search engine for dogs, cats and dogs, they can rig it for anything and that's quite frightening. CARLSON: That's right. Google should not have a monopoly on funny dogs, given all the other monopolies they have, including on public discourse. Chris, we're rooting for you. I appreciate you coming on. Hopefully, you tell us what happens. PAVLOSKI: Thank you. Thank you very much for having me. CARLSON: So Democrats used to oppose monopolies only for like a hundred years. By the way, if it's left to this show, to oppose monopolies? Something has gone very wrong. By the way, it was just last year, the Republicans joined by Democrats issued a joint statement condemning antitrust abuses by companies like Google and Amazon. One person supported that. It is Tulsi Gabbard. She still does. She's a former Democratic Congresswoman from Hawaii and she joins us tonight to tell us what happened. Congresswoman, thanks so much for coming on. TULSI GABBARD (D), FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE: Thank you, Tucker. CARLSON: So this used to be literally from the progressive era until yesterday, was at the center of the Democratic Party's identity, we are against monopolies. When did that change? And why? GABBARD: Well, first of all, let's just be clear from the outset, as we're seeing now, once again, how dangerous these Big Tech monopolies are and how imperative it is that we break them up, that we actually bring about solutions to break up the power that they have amassed. I think the important thing is that we do this through legislative changes and reforms, not through throwing Molotov cocktails and having riots. CARLSON: Right. GABBARD: And this is where all of us come into play that we as voters, we need to make sure that we are choosing leaders who are motivated by serving the American people, upholding our constitutional freedoms and upholding our democracy more than being motivated by selfish interests, and how do I please my Big Tech monopoly donors? And this is where, you know, I think that there's a lot of hopelessness right now in wondering, how do we do this? Hope can be found in recognizing the power in our own voices as voters that we really do get to choose who holds these high offices of power, and that we can make that decision by saying, hey, you need to be someone who I'm confident is committed to serving the best interests of the American people, who is committed to upholding our constitutional rights and freedoms. And you're not one of these people, these politicians who've existed for so long and, and have been a part of the problem because they're so addicted to getting this money from these Big Tech monopolies and therefore, no matter how much noise they make, about how, you know, hey, this is a bad thing, when it comes right down to it, they don't actually do what it takes to make the changes necessary to work for us, the American people. CARLSON: I don't understand why more people aren't outraged by censorship. If Nancy Pelosi was shut down, censored and silence and erased from the internet tomorrow, I don't care for Nancy Pelosi's views. I would swear -- as God watches -- I would defend her. Trump whatever you think of what you said, some of it I don't like, everybody, everybody. This is great. I support this people who should -- Ro Khanna who's like a very smart guy, he is in favor of censorship, like what is this? GABBARD: It's really disheartening to see how people are so inward looking at only supporting the voices of those who agree with them rather than recognizing the country that our founders envisioned for all of us. And, you know, we've talked about this before, as a soldier, this is something that I take to heart in a very deep way like every other service member that we take an oath to uphold our Constitution, to support and defend it, which includes supporting the freedom of speech of every single person in this country whether we agree with that speech or not. CARLSON: Right. GABBARD: Whether that speech offends us or not, that is at the heart of this country and who we are as Americans. And we all must stand up and support that and make sure that we pressure our leaders to do the same. CARLSON: Amen. Otherwise, what are people dying for? I couldn't agree more. It is so nicely put. Tulsi Gabbard, thank you for coming. GABBARD: Thank you, Tucker. CARLSON: So obviously, as we've chronicled the last three nights on television, this crackdown is really clear in its aims: make the President go away. Okay, well, a little over a week, he will be going away. So they've expanded to make everyone who disagrees with us go away, including Republican lawmakers. Senator Josh Hawley is on that list. He joins us next. CARLSON: Some Democrats in Congress are saying they would like to expel Republican officeholders, not censure them, but expelled from the legislative body anyone who questioned last year's election results. Here's the amazing thing. Many of those very same Democrats voted against certifying the 2005 election results. For example, here's Barbara Lee of California in 2005. Watch. REP. BARBARA LEE (D-CA): Thank you very much. Let me say, Mr. Speaker, first of all that I rise to object to the certification of Ohio's electoral vote. In 2004, the democratic process was thwarted. CARLSON: So today that would be known as an insurrection, she would not be allowed to fly in a commercial aircraft. Today, you know -- the good news is we still have a Constitution at least as of 8:51 on Monday night, Democrats can't boot Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri from office. He was elected by voters. But they can do other things to him, like cancel his book contract. Simon & Schuster just did that. They canceled Josh Hawley's book contract, not because they didn't like the book, they commissioned it, but because they don't like his politics. If they can do that, if Simon & Schuster, one of the biggest publishers in the world can do that, where does that leave you? Senator Josh Hawley joins us tonight with his view. Senator, thanks so much for coming on. So you're now one of the most despised people in America. So I appreciate your taking the time for being hated to come on the show tonight. But I want to ask you specifically about what happened between you and Simon & Schuster. And I should say, I've published with Simon & Schuster. I have a book contract for a future book with Simon & Schuster. It's making me very uncomfortable watching what they did to you. On what grounds did they cancel your book contract? SEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R-MO): Well, they don't like the exercise of free speech, Tucker, I think is at the end of the day. I mean, this is really about the First Amendment. It's really about free speech. And Simon and Schuster didn't like me doing what Democrats in Congress did in 2001 and 2005 and 2017, when Democratic Members of Congress objected during the certification process in order to try to have a debate about election integrity. You know, that's the First Amendment at work. That's democracy at work. But Simon & Schuster, and unfortunately, a lot of people on the left now decided that the First Amendment is something that they no longer support. And I'll just say this Tucker, at a time of division, we've got to rally around the things that unites us as Americans, and I think the First Amendment and free speech has got to be at the top of that list. CARLSON: So if some policies -- some creepy low IQ politician says I want to shut down a new site, okay, I get it. But a publisher is literally the guardian of the First Amendment. If you're a publisher, you exist because of the First Amendment. Your duty is to protect the First Amendment. But the people who run Simon & Schuster are now so crazed with ideology that they can't bear to hear a contrary view expressed? I mean, what does that portend for the country? HAWLEY: Well, I think it really shows, Tucker, that we're in a period where the First Amendment values and principles of freedom of speech, also freedom of worship, freedom of religion, these things are really under attack by some quarters -- by many quarters. And again, I come back to the fact that this is something -- the First Amendment is something that unites us, as Americans. And in this time of division, in this time of chaos, we've got to stand strong for that. CARLSON: Man, I hope in their little cubicles at Simon & Schuster, they are so ashamed of themselves, having woken up this morning with an ideology hangover, that they reverse course and bring you back into the public conversation. I hope so. Senator, great to see you tonight. Thank you. HAWLEY: Thank you. CARLSON: We've got more news in a minute. We'll be right back. CARLSON: That's it for us tonight. We will rejoin you tomorrow at 8:00 p.m., by which time some of the people you rely on for news and information may have disappeared from the Internet, but we will still be here. We're glad about that. We will see you then. As always, the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. Have a great night. We're going to toss about 15 seconds early and this is a gesture of both love and respect to our friend, Sean Hannity. It is, it is. Sean Hannity in New York. SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: I mean, people want the full Tucker hour, I'm just saying, for our Tucker fans including myself. CARLSON: I appreciate that. Classification"
2021-02-12,"TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. Happy Friday. It has been a turbulent week, at times pretty grim. But for once in this season of craziness, we have some good news for you tonight and here it is. Two hundred and twelve years to the day after Abraham Lincoln was born, the Democratic Party propaganda outlet that stole his name has finally collapsed. Lincoln's birthday present: the end of The Lincoln Project. We can all celebrate that. There's probably never been an organization sleazier or more vicious in American politics than The Lincoln Project. Naturally, it was funded heavily by the tech oligarchs in Silicon Valley. The Lincoln Project set itself apart from most political organizations by never even addressing for the most part, ideas or policies. Instead, they went personal, always, immediately, right for the throat. Rather than argue against what Donald Trump might be doing or not doing, The Lincoln Project instead threatened his attorneys and then spread filth about his aides. In January, for example, one Lincoln Project executive bragged that quote, ""We are constructing a database of Trump officials and staff that will detail their roles in the Trump administration and track where they are now. They will be held accountable."" It always sounded a little more like MS-13 than a political operation. Now, because everything is irony, there are reports tonight that the F.B.I. is investigating The Lincoln Project specifically one of its founders, a man called John Weaver. Weaver you may remember because he helped manage John McCain's run for President. He also worked for former Ohio Governor John Kasich. He is a close associate of Bill Kristol's, of course, he is. But in his spare time, John Weaver spent enormous energy trying to lure young boys into sex. At least one of those boys was 14 years old. Twenty- one of John Weaver's alleged victims now accuse him of sexual harassment. It's an awful story. But here's the worst part of that story. The Lincoln Project clearly had a pretty good idea what John Weaver was up to, a lot of people did. For decades, political consultants whispered rumors that John Weaver had tried to molest little boys. Karl Rove to his credit once said that out loud. He was promptly attacked for saying it by ""The Atlantic"" Magazine. ""The Atlantic"" protected John Weaver, too. But it turned out to be apparently accurate. Weaver's colleagues at The Lincoln Project knew this, but they hid the truth from the public and from law enforcement. Inside the organization, they made it clear they understood what was happening. We're not guessing at this. Here's an excerpt from a new piece in ""New York"" Magazine. Quote, ""Beginning in September, much of The Lincoln Project staff convened in Park City, Utah where they hunkered down in a COVID safe pod until Election Day."" Can't make this up. ""By this time,"" the quote continues, ""The allegations against Weaver were an open secret in the company according to former employees. One former employee said that's when his boss warned him to avoid Weaver."" Quote, ""'When I was told it was almost in passing, that I did not want to be involved with Weaver specifically because I am a young man,' the former employee said."" ""One night over drinks with much of the staff, four employees recall, Weaver's behavior came up repeatedly as a topic of discussion. One person remembers Steve Schmidt and co-founder Rick Wilson, telling people Weaver was 'depraved' and 'twisted' and that they wouldn't want to know the truth about him."" End quote. So in other words, inside the office, Lincoln Project executives essentially joked about John Weaver soliciting sex from teenagers. And as if this story couldn't get creepier or more repulsive, we also learned this week that John Weaver once operated a children's boutique. Literally. So the question is, why are we learning all of this now? Well, because the election is over, Donald Trump lost, so reporters no longer have political motive to protect John Weaver. Until November, the media had every incentive to promote him as a man of principle, which they assiduously did. Here's John Weaver on ""60 Minutes.""  LESLEY STAHL, HOST, ""60 MINUTES"": John Weaver feels it's the party that's betrayed him. JOHN WEAVER, CO-FOUNDER, THE LINCOLN PROJECT: I mean, look, Lesley, we've gone from caring about character, rule of law, defending the Constitution, a cogent national security policy, free trade. Where are all those issues? Imagine if you travel the country for 30 years, fighting for Republican principles, and you learn it was all a lie. CARLSON: Oh, so it's John Weaver who was betrayed. It's really about character. Really, it's about principle. The Lincoln Project cared about democracy, that's why they did what they did. It didn't have anything to do with the money they got, nothing at all to do with money. They would do it for free. They promised they would. This subject came up a lot, and every time it did, The Lincoln Project employees seemed especially sensitive about the question of money and that should have told you something. Here's Lincoln Project executive, Rick Wilson. STAHL: And I'm going to quote, ""Their failed strategists who are doing this for the money."" RICK WILSON, EXECUTIVE, THE LINCOLN PROJECT: The easiest way in the world for a Republican strategist to make money right now is to shut up and say nice things about Donald Trump. So clearly, we're in the wrong line of work. CARLSON: ""Clearly, we're in the wrong line of work."" It's all pretty funny. Of course, that's the opposite of the truth. That always is. Rick Wilson found the only line of work they would have him and apparently not a moment too soon. Published reports show that Wilson faced liens for hundreds of thousands of dollars in unpaid Federal taxes. Oh, speaking of character. American Express took him to court for not paying his credit card bills to the tune of over $25,000.00. So for a guy like that, The Lincoln Project was a godsend, and we can't overstate that. According to the Associated Press, quote, ""Of the $90 million raised by The Lincoln Project, more than half, $50 million went to firms controlled by The Lincoln Project's executives, $50 million. According to the Federal Election Commission, the F.E.C., in the month of December alone, that was before the Georgia Senate runoff, The Lincoln Project shoveled $1.5 million to Steve Schmidt, who incidentally bought a big new house according to news reports. The Lincoln Project spent $38,000.00 on a private jet company. They spent $1.7 million with Project co-founder Mike Madrid's firm and they gave $420,000.00 to co-founder Reed Galen's firm. I hope these guys saved the money because it's hard to imagine we'll be hearing much more Lincoln Project after today. AXIOS reported that Steve Schmidt has just resigned from The Lincoln Project. He wrote a resignation letter that's online tonight that you should read. In it, he portrays himself as the victim. It's all about him. And then says, he is resigning because the Board of The Lincoln Project has too many middle-aged white men. In the name of diversity, he must go. By the way, The Lincoln Project also saw today the resignation of its spokesman and a couple of other people. Keep in mind, just a week ago, The Lincoln Project was powerful and feared. And now it's done. It's over. It's not coming back. The lesson is: things change fast. Ask Andrew Cuomo how fast they change. A lot of people expected Andrew Cuomo to be Joe Biden's Attorney General, maybe the Vice President of the United States, and for good reason. Cuomo played an instrumental role in Biden's campaign for the White House. Cuomo helped the uni-party leverage coronavirus for political ends. He is one of the reasons that a lot of voters in November wound up believing that Donald Trump was personally responsible for COVID. Some voters appeared convinced that Trump had cooked up the virus himself in a lab deep beneath Mar-a-Lago. Joe Biden knew that these propaganda points were helping him and he seemed grateful for Andrew Cuomo's help. JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Your Governor in New York has done one hell of a job. I think he is sort of the gold standard. I mean, look at the way you have governors like Cuomo who are out there doing -- just keeping everybody informed all day. I think, he is doing an incredible job. I think he has been the lead horse here. I've talked to him frequently. He's a friend. I think he's doing a great job. I really mean it. CARLSON: ""Andrew Cuomo is the lead horse here. He's doing a great job."" Once again, we don't fault Joe Biden for saying untrue things. He's just reading a script. But in point of fact, Andrew Cuomo was not doing a, quote, ""great job"" as Governor of New York, more people were dying in his state than in any other state in the country. But for most of the year, nobody in the media said that out loud. They allowed Cuomo to win an Emmy, in fact, for saying things like this -- GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): My mother is not expendable, and your mother is not expendable and our brothers and sisters, they're not expendable. And we're not going to accept the premise that human life is disposable. CARLSON: ""Human life is not disposable,"" says the abortion guy. Well, thanks to ""The New York Post"" and a handful of other relentless journalists who pursued this story for more than a year, we now know that in fact, Andrew Cuomo does believe human life is disposable because we knew that already. But here are the details. Andrew Cuomo's top aide, a woman called Melissa DeRosa privately admitted the truth in a call with state lawmakers. It's on tape. According to DeRosa, the Cuomo administration deliberately covered up the true number of coronavirus related nursing home deaths in the state of New York. They refused to tell lawmakers how many people were really dying. Why did they do this? Why did they lie? Well, DeRosa explained why. The Cuomo administration was worried that telling the truth about how many people are dying in nursing homes would hurt Joe Biden and help Donald Trump. Quote, ""He (referring to Donald Trump) starts tweeting that we killed everyone in nursing homes. He starts going after New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, starts going after California Governor Gavin Newsom, starts going after Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer."" Then she worried, ""Trump directs the Department of Justice to do an investigation into us. And basically, we froze."" DeRosa continued, ""We're in a position where we weren't sure if what we are going to give the Department of Justice are what we gave to you guys. What we start saying was going to be used against us while we weren't sure if there's going to be an investigation. That played a very large role in this."" In other words, we lied because we didn't want to get caught. The most basic explanation of all. We didn't want to help our political enemies and concede how many people we killed. There are now 15,000 confirmed and presumed nursing home deaths in the State of New York. That's up from 12,700 as recently as late January. We don't have those figures because the Cuomo administration gave them to us. We have them because a few reporters like Andrew Kerr at ""The Daily Caller"" noticed that New York's death numbers didn't count nursing home residents who died of the coronavirus at a hospital. We know it because places like the Empire Center, a think tank obtained a court order, forcing Cuomo to release the data to the public, which owns the data. He owns nothing. He's a public servant, but he wouldn't give it up until forced. If we had listened to the rest of the media, we wouldn't know any of this. We would only know about his Emmy. We wouldn't know anything about Andrew Cuomo's order that forced nursing homes to admit coronavirus positive patients. We'd be expected to believe his excuse that all this was somehow Donald Trump's fault. CUOMO: Anyone who wants to ask why did the state do that with COVID patients in a nursing home? It's because the state followed President Trump's C.D.C. guidance. Who can we prosecute for those deaths? Nobody. Nobody. Mother Nature? God? And you had this political conspiracy theory that the deaths in nursing homes were preventable. I think it is all politically motivated. If anybody looked at the facts, they would know that it was wholly absurd on its face. CARLSON: It's funny how the least competent, least honest politicians are also the most self-righteous. If anybody looked at the facts, they would know this is wholly absurd on its face. And of course, it is wholly absurd, but not in the way Cuomo meant it. Joe Biden is in the White House, in part because journalists and members of both political parties refused to look at the facts and it's time we assess the facts. Honestly. Judge Jeanine Pirro is the host of ""Justice with Judge Jeanine"" on this. She joins us tonight. Judge, it's great to see you. JEANINE PIRRO, FOX NEWS HOST, JUSTICE WITH JUDGE JEANINE: Great to see you. CARLSON: Why did it take the better part of the year to find out the truth about what happened in one of our biggest states? PIRRO: Well, it took the better part of a year because Andrew Cuomo didn't want it to get out. The legislature was asking repeatedly, victims' families were asking repeatedly what was going on, and they refused to give up the numbers. Now weeks ago, Tucker, I said that he should be prosecuted, and I put several crimes on the table because it was a circumstantial case. Now, there is a case that involves direct evidence of a cover up. What you've got is a man who drafted an opinion on March 25th, saying that the elderly who were infected with COVID should go back into the nursing homes. That was a decision essentially to kill seniors, the ones who are the most vulnerable in those nursing homes. He knew it was wrong, and yet he did it. The question is, why did he do it? As a prosecutor and as a judge, that is not an issue for me, but I'll tell you why he did it. He did it to keep the hospitals open. He did it to make sure that the New York hospitals would be able to continue to make money and not have to deal with complete Medicare patients and Medicaid patients. Okay. Then what we've got is we've got him passing a law giving immunity to his pals at the hospitals and the nursing homes from civil and criminal liability. And now, he is intent -- it is evident based upon the statement of his person who didn't -- his Secretary, his right-hand person. She said, oh, I'm sorry to you, Democrat lawmakers, not to the legislators who wanted the answers, not to Janice Dean and her family and everyone else who was affected who wanted answers, not to the public, not to the press. But I ask you this, Tucker, why wasn't the press on this more than -- why do we have to wait for Letitia James? But here's the issue now. Will Letitia James impanel a Grand Jury, instruct her Deputy Attorney General to begin a grand jury investigation? Will the Department of Justice do an investigation on abuse of the elderly over which they have jurisdiction? This guy when he made the statement, he said: ""There's no one to prosecute."" He is wrong. There is someone to prosecute here because he had the intent -- the malicious intent. It was greedy intent. It was reckless actions. It was negligent actions that caused the death of so many vulnerable patients who were denied the ability to even be touched by a family member. And let me move on to The Lincoln Project. Those people are a bunch of bozos. They hated Donald Trump so much that they were willing to commit all these crimes themselves -- sexual harassment, make believe it didn't happen, using money, millions, tens of millions of dollars to use for consultants that they were connected to. I mean, these guys are predators. They are predators. And you know what? It's typical the media didn't look into it. All that stuff about Weaver was on Twitter, nobody cared. Where is journalistic integrity? If it's Donald Trump that we're looking at, everybody have at it. We are not going to check it out. And this bozo thing that's going on in terms of the alleged impeachment, even the Supreme Court won't show up to do it. But this is an example of what we're faced with. We've got a media that doesn't protect the American people, the victims, the workers and everyone else. And I'm going to -- by the way, on my show tomorrow night, I'm going to really go after Cuomo, if you think I didn't do it tonight. CARLSON: You're really going to say what you think. I appreciate it. We'll be watching. Judge Jeanine, great to see you tonight. Thank you. PIRRO: Thank you. CARLSON: Well, it turns out that all your suspicions are true. In at least one case, the Biden administration is literally in bed with some of the reporters covering him. One top Biden aide, pretty touchy about his romantic relationship with a member of the media. That's straight ahead. CARLSON: Well, on Inauguration Day, you may remember Joe Biden's speech writers told him to make an announcement: civility is back in fashion and anyone who disagrees will be treated very uncivilly. BIDEN: I'm not joking when I say this, if you ever work with me and I hear you treat another colleague with disrespect, talk down to someone, I promise you, I will fire you on the spot -- on the spot. No ifs, ands or buts. CARLSON: So Joe Biden laid out the law. The White House would not fight with the press anymore and of course, they wouldn't need to because the press loves them. One top White House official, Deputy Press Secretary TJ Ducklo may have -- well, what you assess. ""People"" Magazine reported on Monday that Ducklo was dating a member of the press, a reporter who covers the left for AXIOS. Remember the Biden administration, very, very close to a reporter who covers politics. So someone over at POLITICO, a reporter called Tara Palmeri wanted to know more about this and reached out to Ducklo for more information. He reportedly responded quote: ""I will destroy you."" He is also apparently accused of threatening Palmeri in other ways. Today, the White House announced that Joe Biden was taking action, that Ducklo will be terminated or put on leave for a week. JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: It doesn't meet our standard. It doesn't meet the President's standard. And it was important that we took a step to make that clear and that included not just an apology directly from him, and apologies directly from us at the highest levels there. But also a step to suspend him for one week without pay. And that in our view was an important step to send the message that we don't find it acceptable. CARLSON: Steve Krakauer is a media analyst, founder and editor of the ""Fourth Watch"" podcast. We're happy to have him on tonight. Steve, great to see you. So just speaking for myself, because you cover this, you probably have different views. But I'm not bothered when people are rude to reporters, you know, I've gotten it a lot, it is fine. I'm very bothered, though, that a reporter would be having a personal relationship with someone that he or she could potentially cover. If you're covering politics, you probably ought to maintain some distance. No one else seems to be bothered by this. Why? STEVE KRAKAUER, FOUNDER, ""FOURTH WATCH"": Yes, right. I think there's two angles to this story. I mean, that one about the relationship between the AXIOS reporter and TJ Ducklo, which we now find out supposedly began in November, they started dating and when the reporter brought it to her bosses, she was moved off the Biden beat and moved to, as you talked about, cover the left, but also to cover VP Kamala Harris. So you're not really going too far from the Biden White House to what she is currently still covering. Look, I think that there's lots of dating and lots of you know, sleeping together that happens between reporters and sources. I don't have as much of a problem with that. But I will say, I think that there needs to be transparency and while the reporter and while Ducklo told their places of employment, the public didn't know. You know, the other -- we don't know and look, a reporter -- CARLSON: That's a good point. KRAKAUER: ... who has power and someone in power, it is a little bit of a different occupation than like a plumber or an accountant. I mean, you have an obligation to the public if you're covering the White House, if you work in the White House, there's a higher obligation there. And this reporter would go on podcast as recently as the Inauguration Day to talk about the Biden administration with no disclosure to the public that she was dating a member of the Biden administration. So I know -- CARLSON: And what were those -- I agree with you. I think it's a really smart point. You know, maybe people should be allowed to assess the facts for themselves and they can decide. But when this reporter went on podcasts for example to talk about the Biden administration, what was your coverage like? Was it critical? Was it skeptical? Or was it fawning? KRAKAUER: Oh, no. This was a -- this is a new era. This is a new tone here in Washington, it is the Biden administration. Look, I think it was not -- it was -- it was what you would expect is what I what I would describe it as, but at the same time, not being -- not disclosing that you have a relationship with a person who works at the Biden administration, I think that's the problem. CARLSON: Right. KRAKAUER: And then, as you mentioned, people can assess. The problem, though, is when it's all completely in the dark and the reaction that the White House does to another reporter, Tara Palmeri, a great reporter who is trying to just bring this to light, which is a story. Look, it's not Watergate, but this is absolutely a story that the public has a right to know about and the media should cover. CARLSON: I wonder when you say, ""I will destroy you,"" you know, obviously, you've got higher testosterone levels than your average liberal, so you know, I nod my head at that. That's good. But it's also a cliche stolen directly from a series of mafia movies. Does anyone in Washington ever come up with their own phrases? Ever? KRAKAUER: Yes. Right. No, yes. It's pretty cliche attack there. Although, I will say ... CARLSON: I will destroy you. KRAKAUER: ... if you go on with any therapist -- yes, it is. It's pretty disgusting. The root that this, you know, TJ Ducklo goes to Tara Palmeri. But I'm honestly most disturbed about the timeline. This happened on January 20th as you mentioned. The White House was informed about this done next day, no punishment was taken to Ducklo until today. The suspension didn't happen. He was in the White House yesterday. So it took -- how in the story come out and embarrass the White House for them to take this, you know, high-minded responsibility and actually suspend TJ Ducklo for a week. That's what it took, not just the action of it actually happening. CARLSON: Right. Interesting. Steve Krakauer, I appreciate your coming on tonight. Thank you. KRAKAUER: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: So as we've told you a couple of times, the new administration has effectively ended Federal immigration enforcement. And as a result of that, some of the most dangerous illegal aliens in this country are being released onto the streets. We've got some exclusive reporting on what exactly that means. Who is being released? That's straight ahead. CARLSON: Well, Joe Biden's immigration policies have had at least one immediate effect, they have created a nationwide sanctuary for people driving drunk in this country illegally. FOX's Trace Gallagher has the full story in that for us tonight. Hey, Trace. TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Tucker. Culpepper County, Virginia is relatively small like 50,000 people, but the Sheriff's Office there has confirmed to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT that in the past two weeks, two illegal immigrants with DUI convictions have been released from jail. One of the inmates had two DUIs, the other had one and was previously deported. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or I.C.E. had detainers on both suspects, but under the new Biden administration policies, the agency was forced to lift the detainers and allowed them to walk free. In other words, it's like sanctuary policies have expanded nationwide. Remember, I.C.E. and other immigration agents can no longer deport illegal immigrants for crimes like assault, money laundering, property crimes, fraud, drug crimes, or DUI. Even Mothers against Drunk Driving wouldn't comment on the policy, quoting here, ""MADD expects all drunk driving offenders to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, no exceptions. The issue of deportation is outside the scope of MADD's lifesaving mission."" But during the campaign, Joe Biden promised he would do exactly this. Watch. BIDEN: You only arrest for the purpose of dealing with a felony that's committed and I don't count drunk driving as a felony. GALLAGHER: Tell that to the families of Drew Rosenberg, Brandon Mendoza and the dozens of other families FOX News has covered in recent years, who lost loved ones to illegal immigrants driving under the influence. Three weeks ago in Portland, Antifa held a violent protests calling for I.C.E. to be abolished. One official told ""The Washington Post,"" the Biden administration has now essentially abolished I.C.E. without abolishing I.C.E. -- Tucker. CARLSON: Trace Gallagher. Amazing. Thank you. GALLAGHER: Yes. CARLSON: So Mothers against Drunk Driving is not mad that the Biden administration is giving a break to drunk drivers as long as they are illegal aliens. The story -- this one really is the story of the betrayal of people by their leaders. Just another example. And here's yet another. You probably heard the Walt Disney Company is in the news lately. But before you think about what that company is doing now, it is worth taking a minute to remember what Disney used to be. Whatever his faults, Walt Disney who founded it, was very pro-American. He believed that this country was a force for good in the world and he did what he could to support the United States. The day after the attack on Pearl Harbor, for example, Disney allowed 500 U.S. Army troops into the Disney Studios in Burbank, and let them stay for nine months. The studio became a staging ground for America's war effort. Disney produced Donald Duck cartoons to promote war bonds. He won an Oscar for a film mocking Hitler. Walt Disney was a committed anti-fascist back when anti-fascism meant opposing fascism, and his work reflected that. The Walt Disney Company today has a very different agenda. Instead of opposing fascism, The Walt Disney Company happily profits from fascism. Let's be specific. In the past decade, Disney has worked directly with China's Ministry of Culture to produce a propaganda film called ""Born in China."" It promotes the Communist Chinese party. Just last year, Disney released the film ""Mulan,"" which was filmed next door to the Uighurs, the ones China had placed in internment camps. That was a propaganda film. In the end credits of that film, Disney made sure to thank the leaders of the province where the Uighurs were being interned, the very people responsible for locking up human slaves by the hundreds of thousands. Hypocrisy? It's more than that. While it was filming in China, Disney was threatening to boycott the American State of Georgia. Why? Because Georgia was considering pro-life legislation. Opposing abortion is barbaric according to Disney, but genocide, no big deal. We're getting rich from it. But the hypocrisy here is not even the most important point. ""Mulan"" like much of what The Walt Disney Company now produces is intended for young audiences. It's rated PG-13 and that film delivered a clear message, unmistakable to children. The people committing genocide in China really aren't that bad. In fact, they deserve our thanks. Of course, Disney was not alarmed when people pointed out how creepy this was last year. Instead, Disney treated ""Mulan"" like a dry run. If you can promote China to teenagers, they've decided, maybe we can go a step further, maybe we can boost our allies in the Democratic Party here at home to even younger audiences, and that is exactly what they're doing. What we're about to show you is entirely real. It's a spot airing right now on the Disney. If your kids watch, they have probably seen. It is not built as a political advertisement. It's a Disney original. It is original content about Kamala Harris, the Vice President, a politician. As you watch this, remember, your children may be watching this right now. They received no warning before they do. You probably don't know they're watching it. Listen to every word of this. Here it is. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Once there was a young girl who used her voice to make the world around her a better place. Some say the odds were stacked against her, but her mother had big plans for this little flower. With freedom fighting in her blood, she led a successful protest so kids could continue to play. She rose to places that no woman had. From front lawn activist to Madam Vice President. She will use her voice to run this nation and inspire it to. Kamala Harris making her story. CARLSON: A lot of messages here, but the most basic one for your kids is if you want to improve this country, what do you do? You protest. You don't work hard. You don't play by the rules. You don't raise decent children. No, you protest, and Kamala Harris led her first protest on a playground. That's basically a miracle. And by performing that miracle, she became part of a divine group of leaders. In other words, Kamala Harris is now transcendent. She's part of a worldwide sisterhood. She's a globalist superhero. Just like Voldemort, you can't really know how to pronounce her name, and just like Wonder Woman, everyone is forced to pretend she is not thoroughly mediocre. All hail, Kamala Harris. Now, if you're thinking to yourself, that's too over the top to be real. It's too obvious. That's the kind of propaganda North Korea would be ashamed to air. Remember, this isn't meant for you. It's not for adults, adult would look at that and smirk at best. But kids don't have those defenses and that's why they're showing it to kids. And for the kids who still aren't convinced, the nonbelievers who refuse to recognize the divinity of Kamala Harris, Disney has another message, and that message is obey or we will hurt you. They made that message very clear this week. Disney fired a popular Star Wars actress called Gina Carano. Why? Because she expressed political views that upset the party in charge. She mocked public health experts, for example, and no one is allowed to mock public health experts no matter how wrong or dishonest or corrupt they prove to be. Contrary to Disney's claims, none of this is about abhorrent language. She didn't utter any. In fact, one of her co-stars use the same language just a few months ago, but he is on the right side politically, therefore he's still employed. This is hypocrisy. Yes. But it's bigger than that. Disney is sending a message. The youngest people in the country now learning the same lessons that kids in China are forced to learn at a young age, dissent is not allowed. Your first loyalty is not to your family, it is not to your God, it is to the government. Unless you want to wind up like Gina Carano, you'll worship Kamala Harris, too. So, censorship is everywhere. It's not just a problem because it violates the First Amendment, it is also a national security problem. What happens when Google decides to shut down The Pentagon for example? That's next. CARLSON: So as we've told you night after night after night, Big Tech is silencing the political opponents of the Democratic Party, and that's a problem for free speech, but it's bigger than that. It's also potentially a threat to our national security. Here's why. Back in 2018, The Pentagon was working on something called Project Maven. That project used Google algorithms to identify drone targets and thousands of Google employees objected to it and Google backed down. So it raised the question, where does Big Tech overlap with national security in the Federal government and how much control over our national security do the technology companies have? Eric Felten has looked carefully at this question. He is a national correspondent with Real Clear Investigations. He just wrote a piece on this out and he joins us tonight. Eric, it's great to see you. ERIC FELTEN, NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, REAL CLEAR INVESTIGATIONS: Tucker, good to see you. CARLSON: For the rest of us who have realized, because you know, it's unavoidable now, these are not companies acting in good faith. They are not companies that seek the best for the United States. It's worth asking to what extent could they have control over our national security? What's the answer to that? FELTEN: Well, the Big Tech companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, they've gone big into government and military procurement issues and it has been hugely profitable for them. Amazon made something like $45 billion last year selling Cloud computing, Microsoft sold something like $60 billion worth of Cloud computing, and this is being sold aggressively to the Federal government and to local governments and governments around the world, as an inexpensive way of getting technology. The problem is that it leaves the Big Tech companies in possession of the technology, and in the position to pull it away from governments, from military, from intelligence organizations if say, if the U.S. got into a war that Silicon Valley didn't like, all of a sudden there would be all of this pressure to not have the technology be used, and we've already seen that not only are the Big Tech companies willing to censor individuals, but we've actually seen the Big Tech companies in action, pulling the technologies away from government. Back in 2019, Amazon was repeatedly talking about how proud they were that they were unwavering in their support of the military, the Intelligence Community and law enforcement. And one of the products they were selling to law enforcement was facial recognition software. But after there were protests last summer, in the middle of those protests, Amazon took away the facial recognition software from police departments. Now, we can have a debate about whether it's a good idea or bad idea for there to be facial recognition software. But I think what we don't want to have happen is police departments come to rely on it and then when there's a crisis, have it taken away? CARLSON: Well, that's exactly right and that's an amazing example, why -- these are not American companies, the people who run them, obviously have no special allegiance to the United States, they don't act in the interest of the United States. So why would The Pentagon for example, not build its own server farms? Why would they allow these multinationals all this control over our national security? FELTEN: Well, they're being sold that it is more secure and cheaper to go with the Big Tech version solutions. And there's a lot of pressure on The Pentagon to go with Big Tech because they're the cool kids. And that means you're getting the best technology. But you know, part of what happens with Cloud computing is once upon a time, if you got software, you'd get a package of discs and you'd load it onto your computer and you would be in control of using the software that you had bought. With Cloud computing, you, through the internet, connect with a computer that is where the software is and that software is controlled by the Big Tech companies. So if you go with them that means you're giving up control of the ability to use that software when you want to use it. CARLSON: Yes, that seems like control you wouldn't want to give up if you're in charge of defending the country. Eric Felten, thank you for your reporting on this. FELTEN: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: So it looks like Andrew Cuomo, Governor of New York may have covered up the number of people who died in nursing homes as a result of his order in order to protect himself from criminal investigation. Will there be one? What consequences could he face? We'll talk to lawmakers looking very carefully at this, next. CUOMO: Flatten the curve, flatten the curve, flatten the curve. We talked about social distancing. Slow the spread. New York has been getting the short end of the stick from this Federal government from day one right across the board. Let's stop just for one moment the partisanship. CARLSON: I think that's the actual montage that ran before Andrew Cuomo's acceptance speech at the Emmy Awards last year. Those were four we had proof that Cuomo was deliberately covering up deaths in nursing homes in his state, deaths that occurred because of his order. Robert Holden is a member of the Democratic Party. He is a member of the New York City Council. He is leading the effort to strip Governor Cuomo of his Emmy. Councilman Holden, I appreciate you coming on tonight. Tell us why you're leading this effort. ROBERT HOLDEN (D), NEW YORK COUNCILMAN: Thank you, Tucker. Well, he has made all the wrong moves so far. And, you know, 36,700 people have lost their lives in New York State and he is taking victory laps. He is a self-promoter. He's got a book, which should be fiction now, listed in the Fiction Section because he has lied all the way through. He has covered up so many things, including probably 6,000 to 7,000 deaths of seniors that he forced into -- COVID positive seniors forced into nursing homes, and then wondered why so many people were dying. It spread like wildfire in the nursing homes, and then he denies it. He blames everybody else for it. CARLSON: He's not only the lying and as you know, that's common in politics, of course, but he does it with maximum aggression and maximum self-righteousness and he is articulate, I will say. How do you lie like that? I mean, that suggests a very weird person. I don't think most people could do that could, could say the opposite of the truth that aggressively. HOLDEN: But they lied -- they even admitted that they lied, because they were afraid of a lawsuit by the Justice Department for mishandling the nursing home situation. So my God, can you -- I don't -- I can't believe this guy, and such arrogance. And he goes on his brother's show, he tells all the great things he's done. What has he done that's great? Except lie to people. He should be investigated and he should be called to task on this and saying, you know what, why don't you admit it? And talk to the families that lost their loved ones. I haven't seen my mom in a year because she was in a nursing home, and obviously, quarantined, and yet, they denied the vaccine to her because Governor Cuomo's edict said, oh, you know what, we can't give it in nursing homes to patients that are rehabbed. They might go out soon. And so you have to get the vaccine, both vaccines in the same place. Well, how do you do that in a nursing home if you're rehabbing for two or three weeks? CARLSON: Right. HOLDEN: So my mom didn't get it in December when she should have gotten it. She got the vaccine too late because she got COVID a month later in the nursing home, and she is now currently with COVID fighting for her life. CARLSON: God, what a sad story. I'm sorry to hear that. The governor is thuggish and famously vindictive. You're an elected Democrat. Are you worried that by saying this in public, you'll be punished in some way? HOLDEN: Not at all. Listen, we have to do the right thing. I don't care if you're a Democrat, Republican or whatever. If you lie to the people, you don't belong in office. And he has constantly lied. He covered up for his image. Can you believe that? For his image? Self-promoter. I don't care. He can't do anything to me. CARLSON: Accepted an Emmy Award. Has he called you? HOLDEN: No. You know, he is -- listen, I do the right thing all the time. I try to. I'm not looking for a career in politics like many of my colleagues, so you have to do the right thing. And that's what should guide everyone, everyone in politics, but when a politician lies and is caught, and then comes up with the excuse, why he lied is a disgrace. CARLSON: Right. HOLDEN: I mean, come on. CARLSON: And blaming everybody but himself. Councilmember Holden, I appreciate your coming on tonight. I think it's a pretty brave stance given it is Andrew Cuomo's New York. Thank you. HOLDEN: Thank you. CARLSON: Well, that's it for us tonight and that closes out what has been a pretty amazing and as we said at the outset, a very turbulent week. We're hoping for more a placid week next week. But no matter what happens we will join you on Monday and every weeknight, 8:00 p.m. The show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. Have a great night and a happy weekend with the ones you love. That's what matters. We will see you Monday. Classification"
2021-01-22,"TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. We don't know about you, but we are thankful that on his very first day in office, Joe Biden addressed one of this nation's most pressing problems: the crisis in girls' sports. The main problem with girls' sports obviously is that they lack diversity, only girls get to play girls sports. That's wrong. Joe Biden plans to fix it. Biden is breaking this country's turf ceiling. For the first time in history, men will be allowed to compete in for example, girls' field hockey and then change in the girls' locker room afterward. Joe Biden has signed an Executive Order requiring it, even Barack Obama didn't do that. So, say with us now, #CivilRightsHero. This is big. There's been a lot of talk recently about women's empowerment, it is a staple of liberal politics, you've heard it before, but it takes a real leader, a once in a generation moral visionary to go further than that, to use Federal power to humiliate and endanger women on behalf of biological men. That is feminism at the next level. That is real empowerment. That's the Joe Biden program. He's been planning it for years. This was Biden last February. JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We all know the animating promise of this country that all men and women are created equal has never been fulfilled. CARLSON: Equal. By equal, Joe Biden means identical. There are no differences between men and women, they are precisely the same. That's his position. Those gender categories we've heard about since the dawn of recorded history are fake. Trump made them up. So there is no reason to protect women from men under any circumstances because the whole idea of men and women isn't real. Not everyone believes this of course, science isn't always popular, the peasants don't understand it. There are still troglodytes out there. In the year 2021, we are trying to keep men out of women's sports if you can even imagine. Yes, Donald Trump is gone, but that doesn't mean hate has taken a holiday. But Joe Biden is not intimidated by that. He doesn't care that pretty much no one in America agrees with him or even understands what he is talking about. When Joe Biden watches girls' gymnastics as he frequently does and doesn't see a single biological men walking the balance beam or swinging from the uneven bars, he doesn't just sit back and accept the status quo, he acts with force and certainty. Activism like that may seem modern, but it is not new for Joe Biden. For 60 years, he has been fighting transphobia, longer than many of us have been alive. Way back in the summer of 1962, decades before it was fashionable, Joe Biden confronted a vicious transphobe called corn pop. BIDEN: Corn pop was a bad dude and he ran a bunch of bad boys. And he cut off a six-foot length of chain and he folded it up and I said, you walk out with that chain and you walk down the car and I said, you may cut me, man, but I am going to wrap this chain around your head. CARLSON: Corn pop was a bad dude, yes, I will say. Corn pop was a bigot. He wanted to keep men out of the girls' changing room at a public pool in Wilmington. It was a different time back then. But Joe Biden wouldn't have it. He threatened to beat corn pop with a six- foot chain and that was just the beginning. Decades later, Joe Biden flew all the way to South Africa to free Nelson Mandela from prison. BIDEN: I had the great honor of being arrested with our U.N. Ambassador on the streets of Soweto trying to get to see him on Robben Island. One of the most saintly guys I ever knew because I got arrested trying to see him when I went down to South Africa. Nelson Mandela. I came back from South Africa trying to see Nelson Mandela and getting arrested for trying to see him in Robben Island, he was in prison. CARLSON: Yes, we saw that, but few of us understood the significance of it at the time. We will admit it now. Most of us assume that Biden was risking his life to fight the racist policies of the South African government. What we didn't know was that Joe Biden was actually fighting a more insidious foe, gender apartheid. Robben Island was men only, second segregated by sex, if you can imagine. But the fight isn't over yet. Joe Biden's holy war of liberation continues. Even now in the supposedly liberated time, groups of women still saunter to the ladies' room together in restaurants across America without a single man joining them in the stall. That happens, believe it or not, it happens right now. Right now, as we speak tonight, there are still sexually segregated public showers in this nation, not to mention dressing rooms in retail stores that men are not allowed to enter. And what about your house? How many boys slept over at your seventh-grade daughter's most recent slumber party? We need to start asking ourselves questions like these. It's time to look within America. Until we can all agree that eight-year-old boys can be strong, independent and sassy women, we are all part of the problem. Joe Biden understands that. BIDEN: The idea that an eight-year-old child or a 10-year-old child decides, you know, I decided I want to be transgender. I that's what I'd like to be. It will make my life easier. There should be zero discrimination. CARLSON: Joe Biden has a solution. Sixty years ago, he fought corn pop with the chain to protect the right of biological men to be present when girls change into their bathing suits and he will bring that same moral clarity to your daughter's lacrosse team. Leadership like that will change the country. In time, you won't hear people claiming to be the first female this or first female that because honestly, in a truly liberated society, who can say what's female? Why shouldn't Mike Pence announce that actually he was the first woman to serve as Vice President? Who could call him wrong? Not us. We don't do hate speech here. Kara Dansky is a member of the Women's Human Rights Campaign. She joins us tonight. Kara, thanks so much for coming on. This is not the first time you've come on our show, we have extremely different politics, but you are one of the very two people in my view whose thought through the implications of this. It sounds like liberation to a lot of well-meaning people, decent people, support this because they think it sounds like it is helping. What are the implications of it do you think? KARA DANSKY, MEMBER, WOMEN' S HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN: So I just first of all want to thank you for having me on the show again, and also, I just want to say this Executive Order is horrendous and it makes a mockery of the rights, privacy and safety of women and girls. It's absolutely horrible. I know that you want to talk specifically about sports and that's great, I'd love to talk about sports. If we could just spend -- CARLSON: I don't -- I want the big picture. I want to know what this means, and I am sorry if we reduced it just to sports because I think you're absolutely right, it is bigger than that. I am just going to let you go and you tell us what you think this means for the country. DANSKY: Great. Thank you. So, by way of doing that, I'd like to say that the Women's Human Rights Campaign is a global group of women who are advancing the declaration on women's sex-based rights before governments across the world including at the international level. This is a document that if enacted into law would specifically and explicitly enshrine women's sex-based rights in lieu of gender identity. And we should say, we are nonpartisan and the reason that we are nonpartisan is that we understand that enshrining so-called gender identity in the law impacts all women and girls regardless of race, regardless of religion, national origin or party affiliation. So, we are very much a nonpartisan organization and we are absolutely dedicated to the enshrinement of women's sex-based rights and anyone can read this document. I'm saying this because the women's declaration on women's sex-based rights explains in far greater detail than we could do tonight exactly why enshrining so-called gender identity in the law hurts women and girls and anyone can find it at womensdeclaration.com. CARLSON: So, it does seem like a major change not just in our law but in our civilization to say that biological sex isn't real and that is the implication of this. What does that mean? It means something for all of us, but what does it mean for girls practically and women, practically speaking? DANSKY: So, globally for thousands of years and in this country for hundreds of years, women and girls have been discriminated against in and excluded from civil society, all aspects of it, specifically on the basis of sex. All of the men making all of the laws for all of that time knew exactly what the word sex meant, and they deliberately kept us out because we are women and girls. And now, with the redefinition of sex to include gender identity, we are supposed to pretend that none of that exists. And I should also mention that the women's declaration has been signed by 13,000 people all over the world including 1,600 in the United States. Women are standing up. We are not having it. And what the Executive Order that President Biden signed on Wednesday does is order Federal agencies to take a look at their own policies and practices and see where sex is defined and to essentially redefine the word sex to include gender identity, and what this will have the impact of doing is obliterating women and girls' sex-based rights at a Federal level. CARLSON: So, I should say that you describe yourself and have on the show as a radical feminist, a sincere feminist on the left. You've said this before in public, you've been saying it. You are one of the very few. You've been really attacked, I am not -- I don't think I'm overstating that, I think people have gone after you physically, why aren't more people on your side, traditional feminists, saying what you are saying right now? DANSKY: So there are a couple of things going on. That is absolutely true. Several of us held an event last year at a public library and as we left the event, hundreds of people ran after us screaming and threatening us. And this happens to women and also men, but mostly women who stand up against this gender identity movement. I also just do want to say, regarding the Executive Order, it does a lot of things. But looking just at the title of the Executive Order, it combines sexual orientation and gender identity and I just want to make it very clear that these two things are very different and the lesbians and gay men who I know do not want anything to do with this movement. Sex is grounded in material reality, as you've said, and that matters a great deal to people whose sexual orientation matters, which is all of us and the lesbians and the gay men that I know want to have nothing to do with this and I think it's important that people understand this. We need to stop saying LGBT -- we need to stop saying sexual orientation and gender identity. COOPER: I am just laughing because one of my producers is saying -- is agreeing with you in my ear. I hear that all the time. I think one of the reasons that people are afraid to speak up against this is they don't want to be seen as anti-gay or intolerant. But I mean, this is a political decision to include a lot of people who don't necessarily have anything in common under one heading so that no one will complain about it. That's my read. DANSKY: I think that that's right and also, I just want to say, you know, where did this come from and why is this happening? One, this is rank misogyny and it is coming from the left. Two, there is a tremendous amount of money behind this movement and if your viewers are interested in learning more about that because I know we don't have time tonight, please visit the ""11th Hour"" blog. It is literally the number 11, one-one, ""11th Hour"" blog. It goes into extraordinary depths to explain where the money is coming from and why this movement is so well-funded. And third, we know this movement has accomplished all that it has been able to accomplish leading and up to and including this Executive Order by stealth. It has been documented that this was a deliberate strategy to go behind the people's backs, behind the media's backs, behind journalists' backs and infect every institution of society. CARLSON: It is so -- and the question is why. I really hope that you will come back. I think this matter. People write it off as a who cares. Bathrooms. Whatever. No, this is foundational. You obviously understand it. You're brave enough to say that out loud. I appreciate it. Kara Dansky, thanks. DANSKY: Thanks for having me. CARLSON: Thank you. And it is foundational. Sex differences are not just something that we meet up at one point, they were the building blocks of human civilization. They are also the source of so much delight and mystery and beauty. It would make life worth living actually in a lot of ways, destroy those and we lose a lot, maybe everything. Well, we've got some exclusive reporting for you tonight. In Joe Biden's first day in office, the Department of Homeland Security issued a sweeping directive calling for a hundred-day pause on deportation. We reported that last night. We now have an internal e-mail sent yesterday to I.C.E. officers in Texas that shows how this order was enacted, and we are quoting. ""As of midnight tonight, stop all removals. This includes Mexican bus runs, charter flights and commercial removals until further notice. All cases are to be considered no significant likelihood of removal in foreseeable future."" In other words, stop sending people here illegally back to the country of origin. The official note goes on to say this and we are quoting, ""Release them all, immediately. No sponsor available is not acceptable any longer."" The official notes the e-mail that he just quote, ""the messenger"" explaining the directive. It wasn't his idea. It was Joe Biden's. Now, this e-mail was news to us, Friday's memorandum from the Biden administration to halt deportations did not call for people here illegally to be released from detention. We made some calls today. We learned that Homeland Security is currently hammering out how to enact the memorandum. It does not specifically call for the instant release of all migrants in detention. So what was this memo about? Just the result of the complete chaos that resulted when the incoming administration on its first day changed the policy this big without explaining what it means. Chaos. We thought the last administration had a monopoly on that, apparently not. Well, people on television say they have discovered the real reason you don't like them is because they are way better than you are, and you resent that. Adam Carolla is here to look at that assessment. Straight ahead. CARLSON: Just got this from ""The Wall Street Journal,"" just second ago. Possibly the greatest headline written so far in 2021. Listen carefully to this, Amazon, the company is seeking to postpone a unionization vote at a warehouse in Alabama and is asking Federal labor authorities to reconsider a decision to allow mail-in voting due to the pandemic. So Amazon and its owner, Jeff Bezos, one of the richest men in the world, the funder of so much chaos that has torn this country apart, is against mail-in voting when it might help his underpaid employees unionize. I wonder why. Because it abets fraud? Maybe he will come on and tell us. It's so great. Well, if there's one thing that people on TV know for certain, it's that they are better than you are. Obviously. That's the subtext of everything. Over at MSNBC on Wednesday, boy, they stopped pretending, one anchor there and a part time blogger explain why she's so much better than you. Listen. JOY REID, MSNBC HOST: The thing the right hates the most about Democrats is that Democrats have the culture. Democrats have the culture. They have the Hollywood culture, they have the glamorous culture, and the right hates that. They feel that the culture is too woke. It's too multicultural. It's not John Wayne anymore. There's all of this multiculturalism and wokeness and liberalism, and they hate it. But they also envy it. CARLSON: So, I'm glad the racist lady on MSNBC can take a moment and tell us what the right really thinks. Thanks for that. I appreciate it. But is that true? Is it true that normal people in this country, not just on the right, but who don't agree with MSNBC, look at popular culture and say, man, that's so impressive, if only I were impressive enough to create that. Is at the root of their anger? We don't know the answer. So, we got in touch with the man who joins us now, Adam Carolla, the author of ""I'm Your Emotional Support Animal."" Happy to have him here. Adam Carolla, good to see you. So, I just -- I'm just speaking for myself. When I see the Kardashians, when I tune in every week, I think to myself, you know, obviously it's kind of garbage. But I'm mad that I'm not clever enough to write something like that. The sort of -- the modern Tolstoy of the Kardashians. Don't you feel that way? ADAM CAROLLA, COMEDIAN AND AUTHOR: It's all projection, Tucker. I mean, you think about it. We always talk about this. They always call Trump a narcissist. But who's the real narcissist here? Who's the ones who are chasing celebrity? Who are the ones who are worried more about how they look in the public square? Who is the real narcissist in this equation? And it's funny, they always think of the narcissist as the guy who is big and puffed up and talking about himself. But I realized that I think Joy Reid is a much bigger narcissist and Donald Trump. CARLSON: What do you say that? I suspect you're right. I mean, and I think it's fair to say, you know, Trump probably falls in the spectrum of narcissism, but I also think you're right, that that woman, the racist lady from MSNBC, probably even a bigger one. But why do you say that? CAROLLA: You know, because I think they look at the entire world like high school. If you really think about the left, and you really think about the mindset of the left, it is, they're perpetually in high school, they never leave high school. It's one big popularity contest. Joe Biden is the oldest homecoming queen or king in history. It's just one big extended high school. It's like they never leave high school. It's one huge popularity contest. CARLSON: So, it does seem to me a little bit like you're saying, the people in charge of our culture are emotionally stunted and weird. So maybe a lot of what they produce projects from that, like their own neuroses get projected forth onto the rest of us who maybe aren't so neurotic and self- involved. CAROLLA: Yes, it's exactly that. I don't think they've ever left that mentality and that's what perpetuates it. So if you get outside of that, if you start talking about lowering taxes or lowering regulation, then you get kicked out of the cool guys club, you get called a racist or homophobic or xenophobic, and you get thrown out of the cool cliques. So, you can't have lunch with the cool kids anymore. And everyone in Hollywood is so perpetually worried about being thrown out of the little lunch circle that they have to keep beating that drum. If you wonder like why are all these people saying the same thing even though it doesn't make sense over and over again, it is a perpetual fear being thrown out of the clique. CARLSON: You've been -- really quick, you've been in Hollywood your whole life. I mean, you're from there. Do you think that part of the anxiety we're seeing from the tastemakers is them slowly recognizing they don't make the taste quite as much as they used to? They're losing control, maybe that's why they're angry. CAROLLA: Yes, you know, this celebrity endorsement used to mean something, right. Now, the celebrity endorsement doesn't mean anything. And as their power lessens and lessens over the years, I think they compensate and they sort of pedal that bike even harder and what you're seeing right now is them on a Peloton just trying to get up to 10,000 RPMs. CARLSON: Getting yelled at by some woman in Spandex. Paddle harder. I love that image. Adam Carolla, great to see you tonight. Thank you so much. CAROLLA: Thank you. CARLSON: Well, the new administration has already enacted a bunch of pretty significant policies. The interesting thing is none of them are popular, putting biological men or women's sports teams -- who is for that? But when you have tens of thousands of Federal troops in Washington, D.C., maybe you can do whatever you want. Is that why they are there? We don't know. It's worth asking the why are they there? That's straight ahead. CARLSON: You may have heard, if you don't live off grid that there was something called an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, an armed revolt without arms. But today in the Senate, Chuck Schumer accused Donald Trump of inciting a different kind of uprising. Rick Leventhal has that breaking news for us tonight. Hey, Rick. RICK LEVENTHAL, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: I see what you did there, Tucker. Charles Ellis Schumer has been serving in Congress for 40 years. So, he's made lots of speeches, and most of them are long forgotten, but this one may live forever. The senior senator from New York is a longtime critic of former President Trump leading the charge for his impeachment trial scheduled to begin Monday. Schumer says it will be a full trial and it will be a fair trial. And then he said this. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): Senators will have to decide if they believe Donald John Trump incited the erection -- insurrection against the United States. LEVENTHAL: So, which one is it? Is it both? We don't know. But it's trending on Twitter and inspired this tweet from ""Daily Wire"" writer Matt Walsh who says, ""I am ready to declare inside of the erection the funniest political gaffe in American history. We should build a statue to Chuck Schumer to commemorate his achievement. That statue will only be from the waist up though, to be safe."" For the record, Tucker, I also cover wars and natural disasters. Thank God, it's Friday. CARLSON: So, you are the perfect man for that story. Rick Leventhal. LEVENTHAL: Thank you. CARLSON: Thank you so much. Great to see you tonight. LEVENTHAL: You, too. CARLSON: Well, the insurrection, if we can call it that, on January 6 was so scary with the Chewbacca guy with the Viking horns and all that, that our government moved 26,000 Federal troops into the nation's capital, mostly National Guardsmen. As of today, long after the fact, there are still many thousands of National Guard troops left in the city. And we heard hours ago, they plan to stay at least through mid-March. That sounds like an occupation of what? And for what purpose? You have a right to ask that question. Matt Walsh is the host of ""The Matt Walsh Show."" He's the one who just wrote that tweet, which we were thankful for. He joins us tonight. Matt, thanks a lot for coming on. So, there's been a lot of new stories today and a lot of conservatives have been outraged that the National Guard is sleeping on the ground in parking garages. And you know, obviously my heart goes out to them. But it's kind of obscures the larger question: why are they there? Why do we have thousands and thousands of soldiers in our capital city tonight, do you think? MATT WALSH, ""THE DAILY WIRE"": Right. Well, that's exactly the point. And first of all this, you know, when you look at the fact that we've got them in parking garages, and they're not being taken care of, it does kind of shed some light on maybe why our adventurism overseas with the military goes awry so often because our -- you know, these morons in Washington, they can't even take care of the troops when they're literally in their own backyard. But what are they going to do if they're in the backyard of some guy in Syria? Maybe that's why it goes wrong. But it is -- the great question, of course is, is why are they there? And, you know, we were told that the reason they are there is because there's this great threat of right-wing riots, there were supposed to be riots in state capitals, all across the country for a week leading up to the Inauguration. There's going to be a big thing on the Inauguration Day. Nothing happened. In fact, we were never -- we were never really given any evidence by anyone that there was ever any real threat of this happening. We're supposed to just take their word for it. So I am left to assume that the reason they're there is to send a message, to send a message to the real enemies of the Biden administration, which are not anyone overseas, but it's their ideological enemies, people like us. They are sending a message to us, which is basically don't mess with us. I think that's the message. CARLSON: I just -- it's hard to believe this is happening and I don't want to stoke paranoia. I think their presence itself stokes paranoia and heightens the likelihood of crazy extremism and acts of violence. I think they're creating extremism by their behavior. I think it's really obvious. I think they know that. I think they may want it. I don't know. But I wonder why -- why is no one asking this question? I've lived in Washington for 35 years. I don't remember thousands of Federal troops there under any circumstances. So, like, why is no one asking? WALSH: It's especially ironic. We call ironic, I think, you know it's -- there's especially a double standard in people not asking when you consider that the people who are looking the other way right now are in fact outright defending the military occupation of the nation's capital are the same ones who lost their mind over the summer, if there was any police response to months of rioting from BLM. I mean, even if just the local police showed up and did anything more than just pat the rioters on the back and tell them good job, anything beyond that, we were told that that is militarization. You know, that is tyranny, it's despotism. And yet we've got the occupation of the nation's capital and we're supposed to just go with it, I guess. CARLSON: Yes. Because we're not at war with our own people. The government is not at war with the American people. And if it starts to be, then we have a huge problem. And by the way, the governors -- don't the governors control the National Guard? Why aren't they bringing their troops back to their states? Like, why are they playing along with this insanity? WALSH: Well, and the other problem is that we need the media, right? They're supposed to be the firefighters, the ones putting out the fires of tyranny, asking the tough questions. Of course, we know that that's not what they really do. But we need them. They're the ones who are in the White House every day, the press briefings, we need them to be asking questions like, hey, why do we have all these troops outside? What's going on? Why are we occupying D.C.? They don't. Instead they're asking about, you know, the color scheme of Air Force One. Those are the questions we're asking. So it's really tough, because we can sit here asking these questions. The White House doesn't care what we say. We need the people in the media to ask and they don't care either. CARLSON: Get your troops off my streets. It's not Managua. You don't own this country. It's really offensive. Matt Walsh, I appreciate your coming on tonight. Thank you. WALSH: Thank you. CARLSON: Well, there's been a major escalation in the ongoing war on free speech online. We're following that story. Unfortunately, I have to tell you more about it tonight, we will in a minute. Plus, there are new signs that there are other intelligent beings in the universe. By the way, that's not a speculation from some nutcase online or even a cable news host. That's according to an astrophysicist at Harvard. Everything we know about a very specific event that suggests we really aren't alone. That's straight ahead. CARLSON: Well, evidence mounts that the question of whether there is intelligent life outside this planet is not just the domain of crazy people online. An astrophysicist at Harvard has found that an artificial object may have been sent to Earth in 2017 from outside our solar system intentionally. That Professor, Avi Loeb details the theory in a new book called ""Extraterrestrial: The First Sign of Intelligent Life beyond Earth."" It is out January 26th. It is being taken very seriously as he is. Professor Avi Loeb joins us tonight. Professor, thank you so much for coming on. This probably requires a three-hour long conversation in a few minutes. If you wouldn't mind summing up what you believe we saw in 2017. AVI LOEB, PHYSICIST, HARVARD: Well, thanks for having me. In October 2017, we discovered the very first object that visited the vicinity of the Earth from outside the solar system. And at first, astronomers thought it's just a rock similar to all the comets and asteroids that we have seen from within the solar system. But as time went on, it looked very weird. It didn't have a cometary tail, no gases around it, yet it exhibited an extra push away from the sun. And the geometry that he had was extreme. When projected on the sky, it was at least 10 times longer than it was wide. And it was tumbling. And moreover, it didn't show any evidence for evaporation. And so, the question arose as to what is creating this extra push that it exhibited. And then one possibility is that it reflected sunlight, and that gave it the extra push. For that, it needed to be very thin. And that was sort of like a sail on a boat, except that the sail is being pushed by wind, whereas this object is pushed by light. And we are currently developing this technology for space exploration. It's called the light sail. And it's quite possible that this object was a thin light sail manufactured by another civilization. I should say there was another object discovered just a few months ago, in September 2020 and that one was extrapolated back in time, and people found that indeed, it was a rocket booster that was launched from the Earth that we produced. It also exhibited an extra push by reflecting sunlight because it was hollow, without a cometary tail, and so we can certainly tell the difference between a natural rock and a hollow object, a thin object pushed by reflecting sunlight, except in the case of this object, we know we produced it. In the case of Oumuamua, the weird object from 2017, we don't know who produced it. CARLSON: What an amazing -- and it is from outside our solar system. Very quickly. LOEB: Yes. CARLSON: And again, I wish we had more time, Professor, what happened to it? Where did it go, this object? LOEB: So, it was deflected by the sun and went in a different direction. In fact, it was sort of parked in the public parking lot in our vicinity, at rest, and the sun ran into it, just like a giant ship running into a buoy. And it just kicked it. And the question is, are there many more out there? And if so, what is their purpose? And gladly within a few years, we will have a much more sensitive telescope serving the sky, and we are likely to find many more of these objects. And you know, a photograph is worth a thousand words. So, if we can send a CubeSat with a camera close to one of these objects that comes towards us, then we can see what it looks like and tell whether it looks like a rock or something very different. CARLSON: It seems worth it. I'm not volunteering, but I think we should do that. Professor Loeb of Harvard University. Appreciate your coming on tonight. Thank you. We will read that book. LOEB: My pleasure. CARLSON: Carolyn Maloney is a Democrat in the House of Representatives from New York, not just any Democrat. She's the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee. She has a lot of power. She is now asking the F.B.I. to conduct what she is calling a robust examination of the social media site, Parler, which has been pulled off the internet in an organized exercise and censorship. She wants to know what role Parler played in the January 6th insurrection in Washington. Of course, Carolyn Maloney is not demanding that the F.B.I. probe other social media services that we know some of the rioters used including Facebook and Twitter, they're fine because they're campaign donors. But rest assured, everyone else, meaning people who don't donate millions to the Democratic Party or support Carolyn Maloney will be thoroughly investigated. REP. CAROLYN MALONEY (D-NY): We are confronting what I never believed I would ever see, a domestic terrorism, led by the President of the United States, an attack against our nation. And I think the impeachment, he deserved it. He led it, he planned it. He instigated it for months. He spoke about organizing around the country and in state capitals. CARLSON: When demagogues like that use government power to crack down on media, we should be very worried. Rachel Bovard is a senior adviser at the Internet Accountability Project and well versed in this topic. She joins us now. Rachel, thanks a lot for coming on. So what Carolyn Maloney seems to be saying that for political reasons, she wants the F.B.I. to hassle, arrest, who knows, a media outlet she doesn't like? Am I missing something? RACHEL BOVARD, SENIOR ADVISER, INTERNET ACCOUNTABILITY PROJECT: Yes, let's be clear. Carolyn Maloney does not actually care about what she is telling you she cares about. Because if she did, to your point, she'd be much more worried about the much bigger platforms than Parler who were involved, or who you know, organized some of these protests. Or maybe she'd be interested in the actual people that committed the violent acts. But no, she wants an F.B.I. investigation into Parler and not just Parler, but john Matze, the founder of Parler and his wife for the sin of ideological wrong think, because John Matze did what you're not supposed to do in this country. He created an actual successful, mainstream alternative to the Big Tech platforms. And for that, he must be punished because he gave too much amplification to conservative voices, so he should never be allowed to make money in this country again and to anyone who cares about liberty, this should be of grave concern. CARLSON: So I went on the websites, the Committee to Protect Journalists, today which raises lots of money to protect journalists. Here are journalists under assault from lawmakers for political reasons. They don't -- unless I missed it, appear to be weighing in in Parler's defense. Is anyone? BOVARD: No. And this I have to say is one of the most frustrating things about this. Every politician, every institution on the right for years has told conservatives who were unhappy with the major tech platforms. Well, just build your own. Well, John Matze did it. And where do you think any of these people have been in his defense? In Parler's defense? From an obviously political collusive corporate attack against this platform, to rip the guts of capitalism away from this platform? They're mute. They are silent. So it makes this whole argument clear. It was intellectually bankrupt from the beginning. It was just designed to protect entrenched market incumbents and you know, I hope honestly, no never listens to these people again because they're not sincere. CARLSON: So you're telling me the Koch family spent hundreds of millions over the years to promote libertarianism, but when it comes down to it, they don't actually defend freedom, it was all really about lowering the wages of their employees. That's actually true, it sounds like to me. BOVARD: They're nowhere to be found. Build your own except when you do, you know, we'll hide behind the couch and we won't come out to defend you. CARLSON: Exactly. Rachel Bovard, it is great to see you. I hope you'll come back. Thank you. BOVARD: Thank you, Tucker. CARLSON: You might have noticed, all of a sudden coronavirus, not getting quite the coverage it did and the coverage isn't as bleak as it was. If you thought that, you've not gone crazy. That's real. Our own Dr. Marc Siegel is here to tell us why it's happening, next. CARLSON: Well, you might have noticed this, the many epidemiologists in our news media are suddenly much more optimistic about the coronavirus. On January 19th, for example, NPR, which you pay for, published a piece with this headline, ""As death rates accelerate, U.S. records 400,000 lives lost to the coronavirus."" On January 21st, the mood suddenly shifted over at National Public Radio and they went with this quote: ""Current deadly U.S. coronavirus surge has peaked researchers say."" Now if we weren't cynical, if we were the cynical type, we're not, we know that January 20th, of course was the day that Joe Biden was inaugurated. Meanwhile, officials in the State of Michigan announced that indoor dining ban will be lifted soon, even though daily deaths in Michigan are higher than they were when the ban went into effect. Amazon, by the way has reached out to the Biden White House to offer help with vaccine distributions. Well, that's pretty nice of them. Why didn't they do it before? Where's all this good news coming from? Dr. Marc Siegel is as FOX News medical contributor. He joins us tonight to explain. Hey, Doctor. DR. MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR: Tucker, the narrative is changing, right? It's no longer you dug too deep a hole. Now, it's you dug too deep a hole, but we're riding to the rescue. Right? So Amazon says, now, we're going to offer services to help with logistics. They also said by the way that they offered the same thing to Trump's Operation Warp Speed. But I spoke to a high level official from the former H.H.S., Health and Human Services tonight who said he was in every single vaccine meeting and their name didn't even come up. So I don't know what the truth is there. But there's no evidence of that. But more to the point. It's also come out this week that supposedly there was no vaccine distribution plan under the prior administration. Well, I have to tell you, I've been reporting for months on that distribution plan and it did not involve Amazon, it involved FedEx. It involved UPS and it involved a huge distribution company known as McKesson and CVS, and Walmart, and at the heart of it was the United States Military with four- star General Gus Perna. And you know what? The problem hasn't been distribution, 38 million doses have been distributed already. The problem has been at the state level, getting it into people's arms. So it looks like that was not only a plan, it looked like it was a successful plan. But meanwhile, the new administration, instead of looking backward, I think, Tucker, they should look forward. And they should say, what tools have we been given? Well, how about a vaccine that it took record time to develop, 10 months, the fastest time in human history, two incredibly useful and safe vaccines have been given to them. Monoclonal antibodies that you can use early on have been given to them. Home testing. We now have the ability to test every home in the United States rapidly to see if someone who could have COVID or not. And as I wrote today, let them get working on a blood test, Tucker, to see if you actually are immune or not, because you know what, I think 50 or 60, or even more million people in this country are immune to COVID because they were exposed to it or they had a subclinical case or a mild case, and they don't know it. And they don't need to be at the front of the line for a vaccination right now. What about those 16 million? Let's focus on them - - Tucker. CARLSON: That is such an interesting point. And you think the number could be that big of people who are immune to it? SIEGEL: I think it could be larger than that. We know that 25 million have documented cases. Well, that's just documented cases. How many people never got tested? How many people just felt fatigued or weak and never got to test it? I find it out on antibody tests way, way, way more than ever get diagnosed. I think 60 million is a conservative number, maybe more and those people are immune and slowing down COVID. CARLSON: That's amazing. I don't think we've talked quite enough about that and I'm glad you brought it up tonight. Dr. Siegel, thank you very much for all the good work you've done for that reporting. SIEGEL: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: Well, we are out of time, not simply for tonight, but for the week. Boy, did that go fast but we will be back on Monday, 8:00 p.m. and every weeknight, the show that is the sworn enemy of lying pomposity, smugness and groupthink, we're obligated by our sponsors to ask you to try and figure out your DVR if you can. Not that we can. At the end of this, we suppose historic week, we hope you get a chance to tune out and spend time with the ones you love. Restorative, most important thing there is. We'll see you Monday. Classification"
2021-01-21,"TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening, and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. It is Joe Biden's first day in office, and you know what that means? CNN can finally take that COVID death ticker off the screen. There's no reason for it now. It's not like you can blame Joe Biden for some Chinese virus that escaped from a lab in Wuhan. It wouldn't be fair. Come on now. CNN dutifully removed it this morning. COVID deaths, settle down, America. It's just a bad flu season. Joe Biden apparently agrees. He and his family were photographed in Washington last night without masks, but not a big deal, explained his flack today, quote, ""He was celebrating a historic day in our country. We have bigger things to worry about."" Okay. Makes sense. By the way, what are those bigger things that Joe Biden is worrying about? Well, since this happens to be Joe Biden's maiden day in the job, we can actually answer that question with some specificity. You can tell what people care most about by what's at the top of their to-do lists. At the top of Joe Biden's to-do list were two things: opening the borders and crushing our country's last remaining independent economic sector. So that's what he is doing. First, Biden signed an Executive Order revoking the permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline. No matter how you feel about fossil fuel, and if you drive a car or fly airplanes or use the hospital or enjoy electricity, you might want to think carefully about how you feel about fossil fuel. There is no question and there's no getting around the economic effect of this decision. Millions of Americans don't have jobs right now. But with a single shaky signature, Joe Biden just put another 11,000 people out of work in this country just like that. But he wasn't done. Biden also instructed the Department of Homeland Security to halt deportations of illegal aliens. And when we say illegal aliens, by the way, pretty sure we won't be allowed to say illegal aliens because it'll be hate speech and therefore illegal. But tonight when we say illegal aliens, we mean millions of illegal aliens, not just the countless undocumented Americans that Joe Biden tells us are busy curing cancer, winning Nobel prizes, and in general, being a lot more impressive than you have ever been. But this doesn't apply simply to them. Biden's order also includes non- Nobel Prize winning illegal aliens, and that means criminals, rapists, murderers, other people who are dangerous to you and me. So the message is clear: if you break our laws to get here and commit violent felonies once you arrive, sometimes against American citizens, Joe Biden will reward you with blanket amnesty. And just to show how much he means it, Joe Biden will do that on his very first day as President. It's a pretty strong, straight statement. So why wouldn't, seeing that statement, every poor person in the world sneak into America? Well, of course they would. You would. We would, and they will. Increasing the size of America's population is the whole point of the exercise and Joe Biden himself explained that when he first started running for President. JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We could afford to take in a heartbeat another two million people. The idea that a country of 330 million people cannot absorb people who are in desperate need, and who are justifiably fleeing oppression is absolutely bizarre. Absolutely bizarre. I would also move to increase the total number of immigrants able to come to the United States. CARLSON: We can afford to take another two million people in a heartbeat, explained Joe Biden. Really? Can we? We are that rich a country. Are we getting a lot richer? Have you done the math on that, Mr. President? How exactly did you calculate those numbers? Can we see them? Unfortunately, we can't see those numbers. Joe Biden is not a numbers guy. Joe Biden is all heart, closer to a religious leader than an accountant and that's why in his first address from the Oval Office, Joe Biden unveiled a bust of Cesar Chavez, the famed left-wing labor leader who led the Great Pickers Union in California in the 60s and 70s. Our easily impressed friends in the media world, needless to say, easily impressed by this. They saw it as a gesture of racial solidarity or something. ""Biden's Cesar Chavez bust in the Oval signals a new era for Latinos, activists hope,"" read a totally real headline in ""The Washington Post."" It's all pretty hilarious if you know anything about Cesar Chavez. Chavez, the man not the bronze image in the Oval Office. The real Cesar Chavez, passionately hated illegal immigration. He said so all the time, he never stopped saying it. Immigration lowers the wages of American workers. That's the whole point of it, of course. Cesar Chavez wasn't well educated, but he was not stupid. He understood exactly what was going on. He was enraged by the efforts to open our border with Mexico. He knew it was another corporate scam posing as a human rights imperative. We must. Right? When the government refused to secure the border, Cesar Chavez's men did it themselves. In the winter of 1979, look it up, members of Chavez's Union, the United Fruit Workers formed what they call a human wet line, as in wet back -- their word not ours -- across the southern desert and brutally assaulted Mexican nationals trying to come north for work. Cesar Chavez's men hit them with chains. That happened for real. That's the guy Joe Biden just told us he reveres. No one believes that. No one knows anything. No one in Central America believes that, believes Joe Biden really has any idea who Cesar Chavez was. All they know is that amnesty has been announced, so of course, they're coming. Why wouldn't they? QUESTION: What do you want for your people? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What I want for my people, I just want patience and pass that we can get to the U.S. because they are having a new President, Biden. He is going to help all of us. He has given us a hundred days to get to the U.S. and give us legal minted paper so we can get a better life for our kids and family. CARLSON: A hundred days. They know the details already, better than most Americans do. He's going to help all of us. And they're right. All of us includes people like Luciano Dominguez-Trejo. He was arrested in this country for sexually assaulting a minor. Thanks to Joe Biden, he gets to stay here. So does Juan Hernandez Rodriguez. Rodriguez is a self- described gang member with convictions for felony grand theft and burglary. He's been ordered removed from this country five separate times, but he's still here. Now, he's staying. So is Atanacio Arellano-Gutierrez, another convicted gang member convicted of felony burglary. Also Luis Rodriguez-Jacobo convicted of manslaughter. Santos Maria won't be going anywhere either, he was also convicted of manslaughter along with armed robbery. When Joe Biden tells you the real threat to our country comes from within, these are definitely not the people he is talking about. Of course, he's talking about you. He's certainly not talking about Fernando de Jesus Lopez Garcia. Like millions of people in California, Lopez Garcia is living in this country illegally. He's been arrested multiple times for violent crimes, but the State of California has allowed him to stay in order not to seem racist. Then finally, inevitably, in November, this happened.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice over): San Jose transformed into a horrific crime scene in what the Mayor says was a preventable tragedy. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Multiple system failures led to this moment. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice over): Police say Fernando Lopez, an undocumented transient used a knife to stab five people at Grace Baptist Church, which was serving as a homeless shelter. Two homeless people, a man and a woman were killed. Two other transients and a church volunteer were wounded. Lopez had been deported three times and has a history of domestic violence arrests. Officials said he should not have been out on the streets. CARLSON: It was a failure of multiple systems. No, it wasn't. Our systems work, we just don't use them. It was a failure of will. It was our country perverted by bad ideas, self-destructive suicidal ideas, which seems to have taken hold among the people in charge. Immigration law exists to keep things like the things you just saw from happening. In a typical 100-day period last year, for example, Federal I.C.E. agents removed 46,800 immigrants with criminal convictions or pending criminal charges. That's a lot of people, 46,000. Now, they're all staying. And that's fine with Joe Biden. It's not like they're trying to operate a restaurant in New Jersey during quarantine or walk through a park without a mask on. They're not criminals. They're civil rights heroes. One thing for certain, they're definitely not aliens, and that's another change we learned about this week. Henceforth, the totally monitored and not at all radical Biden administration demands that Federal agencies refer to illegal aliens as quote, ""non-citizens."" Now that's less precise, obviously, but it's way less racist, so it's better. Joe Biden himself is going to try to remember this. Less than a year ago, he kept forgetting, was still using the wrong term. BIDEN: There are certain things you cannot deport an undocumented alien for, an undocumented person for. CARLSON: Undocumented alien, oh, sorry, undocumented person -- whew. That was close. At 78, Joe Biden narrowly avoided a moment of white supremacy on television. But rest assured, Joe Biden is careful with his language. He knows in the name of unity, people should not be allowed to use certain words or have certain thoughts. Everyone must think exactly the same thing all the time. Now, if that seems like mandatory conformity to you and terrifying, no, it is unity. And that's why in the Biden administration's website, you can now select your preferred pronouns as you fill out the contact form. Bigotry has met its defeat on the White House website. Hallelujah. We do have one nagging question though. What exactly is the point of all of these -- these things that have been done in the last 24 hours? Will any of these changes, these bigger things that Joe Biden has enacted on his very first day in office actually help any living American? We're pretty sure the pronoun thing will appeal to whatever tiny group of deluded unhappy people still believe that destroying nature's gender roles is a form of liberation. Talk about a war on nature. So they're very excited. Congrats to them. But what about everyone else? How, for example, does amnesty and the waves of mass illegal immigration that inevitably will follow make this a better more united country? You're not supposed to ask that question. But it's totally fair. The rest of us live here, we have a right to know. How does this make our country better and more united? Anyone who tries to answer that question, not that anyone has so far, but anyone who does should first have to explain whatever happened to the State of California, the state with the most illegal immigration by far? How exactly in the course of a single generation did the best state in the Union become the worst state? How did the place that so many Americans desperately wanted to move to become the place that millions of Americans are fleeing? Honestly. What's the answer to that question? No, one of the media asked today. But during the briefing, the question of immigration did come up and here's how the new White House Press Secretary responded to it. JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Immigration, we consider as part of racial equity, and part of -- which is a broad issue, but that's how the President has spoken about that crisis over the past several months. And clearly, it is an enormous priority to him. CARLSON: So there you go. That's the answer, I guess. The Biden administration's immigration plan is not designed to improve the United States of America. It's not intended to make Americans happier, or richer, or more secure, or more united. Now, you might think those would be the aims of every government policy, always. But no, not in this case. The point of Joe Biden's immigration plan is, quote, ""racial equity."" Now, we've got to be completely honest with you, and say that we're not exactly sure what that means. The point is racial equity. Unfortunately, nobody asked. In the coming weeks, we're going to do our best to find out since this is a government policy, it matters and we have a right to know. But as of tonight, it sounds a lot like punishment. Mass immigration, explains Joe Biden, isn't something that will make your life better. It's something you deserve. Ned Ryun is the CEO of American Majority. He joins us tonight. I'm just so struck by this, Ned. People have debates over policy, what's good for the country, what's not good for the country? I think honest people can disagree. I've changed my view on a lot of things. NED RYUN, FOUNDER AND CEO, AMERICAN MAJORITY: Right. CARLSON: I have never seen an announcement of such huge policies made without any reference at all, to their effect on the American populations. Like that's not even up for discussion whether it's good for us, we're doing it. RYUN: That's right. No, it's because it's very clear from their actions. The American people are not even an afterthought there. It's clearly not a priority. I mean, my thought as I'm listening to your monologue is: what's the point of calling yourself a sovereign nation if there's no enforceable borders? If we're just going to tell the world, feel free to come and literally hop on our social welfare programs, which are failing, by the way. Which oh, by the way, the other amazing part to me, Tucker, about this idiocy on the immigration front. We are literally going to be importing small cities of low-skilled or unskilled workers every month into our country in the face of automation. What are we going to do when they're out of work? When their jobs are automated? Throw them onto our social welfare programs? How are we going to fund that while the American people are going to get taxed more draconian taxes to actually fund it? You're going to be working for the state before you know it. There is nothing right now, and I would argue, Republicans are the same way that prioritizes the interests of the American worker and the American taxpayer. That's why Trump -- I mean, the amazing part in all of this, Tucker, is that nobody in D.C. establishment, Democrat or Republican want to even ask the question, why did Trump win? Oh, I don't know. Maybe because he stood up and said, hey, here's a shocking concept. Why don't we actually prioritize the American worker and the American taxpayer and advance and promote their interest and policies that do that? And nobody wants to ask that question. CARLSON: You don't even hear it. You don't even hear it raised. I mean, if you cared about the country, and no matter what your voting history was, you would say it's a pretty volatile time in American history. We actually could, you know, have real unrest. Maybe radical change is not a good idea right now. RYUN: Not right now. CARLSON: Maybe we shouldn't change the way we vote or change who lives here by the millions overnight. Maybe that much volatility could break the country. I haven't heard one person say that we're the liberals of goodwill and good faith -- patriotic liberals saying, let's just settle down for a second. Where are those people? RYUN: Do they still exist? I mean, a serious question, Tucker. I'm not sure that they actually exist anymore as the left has completely taken over the Democratic Party. I mean, you made an interesting point. The fact that Biden made immigration, killing the Keystone Pipeline, removing the Mexico City language that now uses taxpayer dollars to fund overseas abortions. And oh, by the way, an Executive Order for biological males to go and play on girls' teams and be in their locker rooms shows his priorities. None of those had anything to do with any of the American priorities in regards to actually how do we get back to work? How do we stop these stupid lockdowns? How do we go back to normal? And it showed all of his priorities are the far left because they've taken over the party. There aren't any rational liberals left inside the Democratic Party. And if they are, they've been silenced. CARLSON: I don't think there's a single survey you can find, a real one that shows any of those issues in the top 10 list for anybody -- for anybody. RYUN: No. CARLSON: Only the super unhappy activist groups whose lives depend on pushing for some new and exotic attack on nature, are in favor of this. It's really a triumph for special interest politics, I would say. RYUN: But the amazing part is each one of those issues actually goes after the pipe workers. They endorsed Biden. He does this. It costs him tens of thousands of jobs, importing low skilled laborers going to hurt the minority, especially the black community. All of this stuff of the biological males is going to hurt the suburban moms and their daughters' athletic careers. Like these are the people that voted for Biden. What were you doing? CARLSON: No, no, he's following the orders of his corporate masters, obviously. RYUN: That's right. CARLSON: Ned, it's great to see you tonight. Thank you. RYUN: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: Well, we've been against, obviously, violence and terrorism since the day the show went on the air. But last night, we told you we ought to pause and think deeply about this new administration's war on domestic terrorism and what it means and what effect it might have on your ability to live in this country as a free citizen. A Member of Congress by the name of Brad Schneider lashed out at us and accused us of supporting death and killing for raising those questions. We asked him to come on the show tonight, of course he didn't because he's afraid. But we thought deeply about what he said we'll respond to it after the break. CARLSON: When the rest of the media and many in the Congress were either ignoring or making excuses for the riots we saw for months in this country, we came out on the air almost every night and told you we oppose political violence of all kinds. On January 6, there was political violence at the Capitol and we opposed that. But one thing that we oppose every bit as much is the destruction of the civil liberties that make this America, make it a country you would want to live in. Now that point used to be uncontroversial, particularly on the left. But now, outside a handful of principal mostly far left figures, none of the self-described liberals in the Congress will say this out loud. Instead, they're moving in the other direction at high speed. Democrats are rushing to embrace a new surveillance state in the wake of the January 6th insurrection, using that day as a pretext for creating say, a new secret police force. Not making that up. We told you about this last night and we mentioned specifically a Member of Congress from Illinois, a character called Brad Schneider. Schneider says he'd like to pass something called the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act. Apparently, Brad Schneider was watching last night. As you hear his reply, ask yourself: is this the guy you want in charge of preventing domestic terrorism? Here's how he responded, quote: ""Do I want to see increased monitoring of the types of violent extremist domestic terrorists that attacked the Capitol leaving five people dead, including a police officer? Absolutely. The real question is why Tucker Carlson is okay with their deaths?"" Right. So if you have questions about handing Brad Schneider, whoever that guy is, the keys to your country, voiding the Bill of Rights because Brad Schneider demands that you do after the insurrection on January 6th, then you're killing police officers. You want people to die and maybe you need your civil liberties taken away. We'll see. Now if this all sounds familiar, it is because every time something horrible happens, creepy little demagogues like Brad Schneider rush to the microphone and tell you, I'm sorry, you can't be free anymore. It happened after 9/11. 9/11? What does it have to do with January 6th? It seems like kind of an odd comparison. In fact, so disproportionate it's laughable and offensive to the 3,000 people who died on 9/11. But Members of Congress are invoking anyway, by the way, from both parties. In the same briefing where Brad Schneider gave his stupid and scary opinions, another Member of Congress, a former F.B.I. agent called Brian Fitzpatrick said we must adopt the same attitude toward domestic terrorism that we had toward al Qaeda after 9/11. REP. BRIAN FITZPATRICK (R-PA): When you look at what our response was to 9/11, we said never again. We created a brand new department, a Secretary level position in the Cabinet, an entire new department, the Department of Homeland Security. We took a lot of steps to make sure that we were going to say never again where we go and experience something like 9/11. We need to have that same never again attitude towards domestic terrorism, because both are an equal threat. CARLSON: What? Who is this guy? Why is he in Congress? We think he's Republican, by the way. Who cares? That's insulting. What happened on January 6 was on videotape. You saw it. It was bad. We denounced it, we will denounce it again and every day, because who cares? We feel that way. But to compare that to 9/11? If you're saying that with a straight face, you're a liar and you have an agenda that should make all of us nervous, but a lot of them do. Another congressman, Lou Correa admitted that the quote, ""Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act is just the beginning."" There's a lot more domestic spying to be done, he promised. REP. LOU CORREA (D-CA): This is the first step in a long procession of actions we have to take to make sure we address the issue of other Americans terrorizing other Americans in this great country. CARLSON: Yes, okay. The next step in a long procession of actions. Okay, let's just be completely clear. Unlike the many of the people you see calling for new secret police force to be created, we are against all political violence. But no matter how much of it occurs, we are still Americans. We were born here. We have the right to say whatever we believe. Period. You cannot abridge that right. We have the right not to be spied on by our own government for having political opinions that people in power disagree with. Period. And anyone who tries to take those rights away is a far greater threat to this country than anyone who showed up on the Capitol on January 6th. Period. And everybody should say that because it's true, and it would be true if the roles were reversed and the other party was upset. It doesn't matter. These are immutable, undying principles that form the basis of American history and culture and life. And when they cease to be at the center of our national life, you ought to leave. It is not worth living in a country like that. Well, if you thought Joe Biden's Inauguration meant the end of fascism in this country, I've got some bad news for you. It turns out fascism is still alive and well and it's highly concentrated in the Pacific Northwest. Last night in Portland, Seattle, Antifa members once again attacked Starbucks and then turned their attention the headquarters of the Oregon Democratic Party. CARLSON: Police made more than a dozen arrests. One person was carrying a large knife, bear mace, gas mask and a collapsible baton. Another police said, he had a backpack full of Molotov cocktails. So this looks a little different from what we've seen earlier in the year, maybe now the Democrats run everything they won't be so pro Antifa. Just a guess. Jason Rantz has been on this story since the first day. He is a radio show host in Seattle. He joins us tonight with a prediction on that. Jason, good to see you. JASON RANTZ, SEATTLE RADIO SHOW HOST: Good to see you. CARLSON: It seems like more of a crackdown we've seen before. By the way, I'm in favor of cracking down on violent crazies like Antifa, but has the response changed? RANTZ: Their response has changed maybe a little bit. I think it looks a little bit more aggressive than we've seen in the past. The question is, will they actually keep up with it? Because in the past, anytime that police have gotten aggressive, you have city leaders both in Seattle and Portland pushing back against the police for being too aggressive. We had a case just last night with one of the arrests were the person who apparently told police that he admitted to breaking into the Starbucks was just released by a judge on his own personal recognizance. So they're not taking this seriously, outside of these arrests, which just means it's going to continue and continue and continue. And as you have these conversations about you know, the Democrats saying that they want to root out domestic terrorism and they are focusing on white nationalists and militia right-wingers. We have a literal group of domestic terrorists who plot openly on Twitter, not Parler, but on Twitter and Facebook. They self-identify as Antifa. They have a flag. They have a uniform and black bloc, they all dress exactly the same, and they have a radical, ideological perspective. If you want to root out domestic terrorism, you go after Antifa instead of pretending that it's a mythical group created by the right or it's simply an idea whose ideas are so, so, so damaging that buildings end up collapsing once they utter them. It's absolutely ludicrous. CARLSON: At some point, I'd love for you to take a camera. We're out of time of course, but I hope you'll come back and just get a camera and show us what downtown Seattle and Portland look like after months of unrestrained lunacy. I'm serious. These are great American cities and what do they look like now? I hope you'll come back with that, Jason Rantz. RANTZ: Absolutely. CARLSON: Thank you. Well, you've been hearing about reparations for years. It is something Al Sharpton used to talk about a lot, but in the name of something called equity. What does that mean? There's a new push for something called voting reparations. It sounds crazy. But what we've learned, don't dismiss anything. It is possible. That's straight ahead. CARLSON: Well, the word of the year appears to be equity. You're hearing that a lot from the Biden administration -- Biden administration, that sounds weird to say -- and from the whole Democratic Party, once again, equity does not mean equality. All Americans, albeit a few demented people aren't, but most Americans are totally for equality because God created us all, therefore we're inherently equal. Equity is very different. Equity is a pretext for racial discrimination. In a recent issue of ""The Nation,"" a Professor at Washington and Lee University called Brandon Hasbrouck offered his prescription for equity. In the piece, Hasbrouck makes the case for double counting the votes of African-Americans. The Professor calls that a form of vote reparations. Horace Cooper is the Co-Chairman of Project 21. He joins us to assess. Horace, thanks so much for coming on. On some level, I feel a little guilty even mentioning this because it's such a poisonous and divisive idea that you don't even want to amplify it. On the other hand, you think well, the things we ignored in the past suddenly became Federal law, so maybe it's worth explaining it before that happens. What do you think of this? HORACE COOPER, CO-CHAIRMAN, PROJECT 21: Oh, I agree with you a hundred percent. In fact, I would never have even written about this in ""National Review"" if I had seen other people come out and condemn this. This is really insidious. This, however, is what we get when we have not allowed the kind of criticism that needs to occur for all of those voices, not just Professor Hasbrouck's, but I'm talking about the Biden administration. I'm talking about prominent progressives who have been saying over and over again that America is more racist or as racist as it has ever been and denying any progress. CARLSON: It does seem though, and call me naive, but I actually loved the sentence in Joe Biden's Inaugural yesterday when he said it's about unity. It's about bringing the country together, remembering that we're all in this together. I just -- I couldn't love that more. But I can't think of anything that is more divisive than the idea that some people get an extra vote, like, isn't it obvious to people proposing this that would divide the country irreparably? COOPER: I think it is obvious. But here's the question I want to ask, like those old segregationists of yore, some of them went around saying they wanted to keep us separate because it was good for us. They were actually trying to help us. Others did it because they thought it was politically salient to do it. Here's my question. Are those advocates today doing this division on the basis of race? Because it's politically salient? It will empower them? Or are they genuinely people who believe that we need to separate ourselves and organize ourselves primarily on the basis of race? Either way, it's evil, and either way, it deserves condemnation. CARLSON: I agree with that. Just say it out loud. Horace, great to see you tonight. Thank you. COOPER: Thank you. CARLSON: One of the reasons that people don't denounce ideas like the one you just heard is because they don't want to talk about race. A lot of people don't want to talk about race all the time. We certainly don't. It's so ugly. And like, what's the point? You'd rather talk about things that you can change. No one can change his or her race. So like, why are we obsessed with it? But they keep throwing it in the face of the country, so it's kind of impossible to avoid it. In 24 hours, Biden has hit that topic in a hundred different ways. He just rescinded an Executive Order from the previous administration that barred training sessions in the Federal government that amounted to racial attacks on government employees. Now, in the past, Joe Biden who may not know the difference, by the way, he is pretty out of it, has said these sessions are nothing more than racial sensitivity training, right? BIDEN: The fact is that there is racial insensitivity, people have to be made aware of what other people feel like, what insults them, what is demeaning to them. It's important to people. No, they don't want to -- many people don't want to hurt other people's feelings. But it makes a big difference. CARLSON: Of course, that's the opposite of the truth. He's not upholding racial sensitivity, no normal person is against racial sensitivity or sensitivity of any kind. Being sensitive is essential if you want to get along with other people. These are racial attacks, flat out, attacking people for the way they were born. The Executive Order of the Biden administration just undid blocked taxpayers dollars from going to the lunatics who do this, who teach that the U.S. is an inherently racist or evil country or that any race is inherently evil or racist because that's just a lie and nothing hurts this country more. They should stop this stuff. Chris Rufo is with the Discovery Institute. He is a contributing editor at ""City Journal."" He has announced a new coalition of lawyers that will fight this stuff in court because it is going to wreck the country if we don't pull back. He joins us tonight. Chris, thanks so much for coming on. Appreciate it. So tell us -- I think you've been on a number of times to explain what's happening in the Federal bureaucracy where people are told they have to sit there and get attacked because of the way they look. Tell us how you're going to try and end this appalling un-American federally subsidized exercise and race hate. CHRISTOPHER RUFO, RESEARCH FELLOW, DISCOVERY INSTITUTE: Well, as soon as Joe Biden won the election for President of the United States, I knew that he was going to scrap this Executive Order that he worked on. So I immediately started reaching out to conservative legal organizations and attorneys, and to my dismay, discovered that nobody was working on this issue in the courts. So I took some leadership and recruited a team of half dozen legal foundations and law firms to fight this in the courts, to take cases hopefully to the Supreme Court that show these trainings that traffic in racial stereotypes that compel speech and to create hostile working environments are not racial sensitivity training, but they're actually illegal under the Civil Rights Act, and unconstitutional under the law. CARLSON: Yes. And so obviously, so. I mean, the liberals who taught me in elementary school would always say, and they were totally right, don't judge a book by its cover; judge people by who they are inside. Are there any liberals joining you in this effort to stop these racial attacks? RUFO: There are. There is a really breakaway sect of liberals that have said that Critical Race Theory goes too far. It's abandoned the core concepts of classical liberalism, which say that we're all equal under the law. And to your point that you made earlier equity and social justice is this idea that we're actually not equal under the law and that the government has to take it upon itself to reorder society's fundamentals. That's antithetical to everything that we believe in. That's antithetical to our entire history of progress. And sadly, the people who call themselves progressives fail to recognize any progress in the past, and they fail to take any action that could make progress in the future. CARLSON: I agree. You can't have a country under these terms. They won't work. Chris Rufo, thank you. Well, the Chinese Communist Party was, of course, thrilled to learn the U.S. has rejoining the World Health Organization, but they weren't the only ones. Tony Fauci is very excited. Dr. Fauci. We will tell you why, next. CARLSON: Tony Fauci, who is a doctor and authoritative and not at all over his head and making it up as he goes along announced today that he is thrilled our country is rejoining the World Health Organization. We owe the World Health Organization a deep debt of gratitude, he says. DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: I join my fellow representatives in thanking the World Health Organization for its role in leading the global public health response to this pandemic. And as such, I am honored to announce that the United States will remain a member of the World Health Organization. Yesterday, President Biden signed letters retracting the previous administration's announcement to withdraw from the organization. CARLSON: Pretty amazing statement given all we know about the World Health Organization. Lanhee Chen is a fellow at the Hoover Institution and joins us tonight. Lanhee, thanks so much for coming on. I mean, just lay this out for us, if you would crisply, the World Health Organization has led to fight against COVID. Is that true? LANHEE CHEN, FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION: It's absolutely not true. In fact, they actively fought against the world knowing what China was doing early on. They actually colluded with the Chinese to claim that COVID could not be transmitted from human beings to human being. Then they went and said China was doing a great job trying to contain the virus when in fact, the virus had already left and infected 100,000 people in the region. And then subsequently, they continued to lavish praise on Chinese leader Xi Jinping about China's COVID response. So no, the W.H.O. has done nothing but fail again and again, and now American taxpayers should be upset that $400 million a year are going to the W.H.O. without any accountability from the organization whatsoever. CARLSON: So you know that, you're an expert. I know that I'm just a talk show host who reads the news. Dr. Fauci must know that since it's his job, so why do you think he would say something like this? CHEN: Well, he also, by the way, lavished personal praise on Tedros, the leader of the W.H.O., who, by the way, is the individual that's the most corrupt in the middle of all of this. So, you know, look, there's this public health cabal out there that I guess, folks are part of, they feel the need to cater to this group of people. But the reality is, we should be focused on solving the problems created by COVID-19 not joining the W.H.O. and trying to cover up the problems that this organization created. So I don't know why he did this, but this to me should make every American taxpayer upset. CARLSON: I mean, especially since we really kind of need to trust our public health authorities. This does not inspire trust. This makes me not trust anything they say, which is very bad, isn't it? CHEN: Well, that's precisely the problem is that the public health authorities should be the one giving us guidance on the best things we can do to defeat this virus. But instead of creating trust, all they do is create anger because of the hypocrisy that comes from the kinds of edicts that get issued by these various authorities. So yes, this is absolutely a huge problem, Tucker. CARLSON: It's so nicely put, Lanhee Chen, appreciate your coming on tonight. Good to see you. CHEN: Thank you. CARLSON: Thank you. Simon & Schuster, one of the biggest publishers in the world decided to censor Josh Hawley's book earlier this month because they didn't like his politics. There's been a major development in that appalling story and a win for free speech center. Senator Hawley joins us after the break to explain what happened. CARLSON: Earlier this month, we told you when it happened, the publisher, Simon & Schuster cancelled the book by Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri they were planning to release. They issued a statement at the time justifying it this way, quote: ""We cannot support Senator Hawley after his role in what became a dangerous threat to our democracy and freedom."" What was that dangerous threat? No, he didn't storm the Capitol. He voted the exact same way that many Democratic members of Congress had voted in a number of previous elections. That was a threat to our democracy. So his book wasn't getting published. Now, the publisher, Regnery has decided to publish it. The book is called ""The Tyranny of Big Tech."" The President of Regnery said this, quote: ""The warning in his book about censorship, obviously couldn't be more urgent."" We invited Senator Hawley on tonight to explain the status of all this. Senator, thanks so, so much for coming on. I think it sounds like a really interesting book and I'm grateful that someone is brave enough to publish it. What have you learned from this experience? SEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R-MO): Well, I've learned Tucker that what these corporations want, and unfortunately, what many on the left want is control. And they don't want unity. We hear a lot of talk now about unity, but sadly, I think they don't want unity, they want control and they want you to have the same opinions, voice the same opinions, toe the party line, and if you don't, then they're willing to use every power at their disposal to shut you down. That's what they've been trying to do with many, many conservatives. And it's not just me. It's many, many conservatives. And that's why for those of us who believe in the First Amendment, believe in the right of free speech and the Constitution, we have to take a stand and we can't allow this to happen. CARLSON: I think that's exactly right. And I should say this in full disclosure, I have been published by Simon & Schuster. I have another book under contract to be published. I told them directly, I'm disgusted by what they did to you, not for any partisan reason, but because I believe in free expression, and I don't think you should bow to the mob as they did. But I wonder going forward, I mean, you found a publisher for your book, but you're a United States Senator, presumably there are other people whose intellectual life has been snuffed out by this moment of uniformity that we are in, enforced conformity. Are you worried about that? Like, what does it do to the country? HAWLEY: Oh, I'm very worried about it. I'm very worried about it. I'm worried about the folks who have small businesses who have been threatened with boycotts. I'm worried about folks who have been kicked off of social media, or threatened on social media, folks who feel that they are under siege and that is a lot of this country. Tucker, it's a lot of the people that I represent. And this is a moment, I think that is very scary for a lot of people because you see the left and the corporations. I mean, these monopoly corporations working hand in glove with the left to try to silence speech on a scale that frankly, I've never seen in my lifetime. And this is a moment where those of us who believe in the First Amendment and by the way, whatever political persuasion, whether you call yourself a conservative or liberal, whatever, if you believe in free speech, this is a time that you've got to take a stand and say, hold on, hold on. We've got to preserve this as Americans. CARLSON: You'd think that publishers, journalists, people who make a living exercising their First Amendment rights would see this and want to defend you from this censorship. Have any? HAWLEY: Not really. Not that I'm aware of. Regnery, who is publishing the book has been very brave, of course, but they're independent, Tucker. I mean, come back to the problem of monopoly control, what you see is, there is so much of the power in this country is consolidated into so few hands. We have only one or two major commercial book publishers, corporate publishers in this country. Ditto with the Big Tech companies, of course, which is what my book is about. So it really takes these independent voices to say, whoa, we're not going to be told to bend the knee. And what we need now is for everyday citizens to say we're not going to be told to bend the knee, we're going to stand up for what we believe as Americans, the First Amendment of the Constitution. CARLSON: Amen. I would be glad to talk to you if you were a Democratic senator I disagree with because I think the principle matters. Big is bad. That's the lesson of the moment. Senator Hawley, appreciate your coming on. I'm glad your book can be read. HAWLEY: Thank you. CARLSON: We're out of time. We'll be back tomorrow night, 8:00 p.m., the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. By the way, check out Brian Kilmeade on 7:00 p.m. He'll be there tomorrow night. Sean Hannity, next. Classification"
2021-02-16,"TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening, and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. We spend an awful lot of time in the show night after night trying to explain what is happening to our country, and it's depressing a lot of the time because the answer is always the same. America is not rotten, it's a great place. The people who run it are rotten, so you've been betrayed by the people who lead you. And that's why things are so volatile. What you're looking at is a crisis of our institutions, our institutions are corrupt; some of them are collapsing. We say that a lot because it's true, but we should be more precise. Not all of our institutions are the same. Some of them are bad, some of them are awful. But looming above the rest is the worst of all, and that's the news media. They're the most corrupt. How corrupt is the news media? Imagine a drunken teenage border guard at the crossing between Togo and Burkina Faso, shaking you down at midnight as you pass through. ""The New York Times"" is much more corrupt than that. The media are more crooked than Jimmy Hoffa ever was. They are more dishonest than your average bribe taking building inspector in Queens. They are more treacherous than the mafia. They make cops in Tijuana look trustworthy. You'll get a fair treatment from an inner city DMV than you would from CNN, ask Nick Sandmann. We could go on. Words can barely express the truth of it. Watching the news on television makes you question the system itself. In what version of quote, ""meritocracy"" can someone like Chuck Todd get rich and famous? Dumb and conventional now pass as impressive? It's insulting. But rather than be insulted, we've decided to pause for a moment and look at it a different way. Yes, the news media are profoundly dishonest. All of us lie from time to time, that's the human condition. But imagine if lying was your job. Imagine forcing yourself to tell lies all day about everything in ways that were so transparent and so outlandish that there is no way that people listening to you could possibly believe anything you said. Then imagine doing that again and again, and again, every day of your professional life for your entire life. Could you do that? If you could, CNN has an opening on the media analysis desk. Call them immediately. But if you're a non-sociopathic, normal person, the answer obviously is no, you could not do that. You could never lie like that. So you've got to kind of respect the people who can. They're like Olympians in reverse. They achieved feats so dishonorable that you gasp in horror as you watch them. But at the same time, you've got to respect those skills. Take a look at these gold medalists in duplicity and ask yourself as you watch, could you say something like this with a completely straight face about Kamala Harris? NICOLLE WALLACE, MSNBC HOST: She is incredibly successful and she does everything professionally with the utmost integrity. CLAIRE MCCASKILL, MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST: Kamala Harris is independent, successful, strong, but she's also a devoted wife and she is not ashamed of that. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And I would say that her performance as a running mate was flawless. I mean, other than Barack Obama in my career, I've not seen anybody really who came in with that kind of raw material, even she fits the moment in such a powerful way. WALLACE: She is what every working woman strives to be. CARLSON: Of course, she is flawless. Kamala Harris is everything women want to be: false, hollow, cunning, consumed with political power, really a model for your daughters. Make that woman Vice President. And so they did. And on the night they did, they celebrated. In fact, celebration might be too mild to word. What happened on cable television that night is typically, and by law, in a lot of places, confined to bedrooms and other private spaces. But that night, they did it in public, and they were proud of it. Here was prime time over on CNN.  CHRIS CUOMO, CNN ANCHOR: How are you feeling? DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR: It's -- I almost can't talk right now because of the emotion. Everyone is welcome under this tent. We don't care who you are. We don't care if you voted for us or not. You're all part of this American experiment. It was -- I was so overwhelmed to hear that. I don't care what people think. If they think I'm biased or not, I don't care. And so I'm very emotional, so when you ask me how I'm feeling right now, I'm sorry. That's all I can tell you. This is how I feel right now. I am so happy to have this platform to be able to do this. I may not have it after this, but I really don't care. I am so happy. CARLSON: Everyone is welcome under this tent. They're all invited, except the white supremacists and the QAnon people and anyone else who disagrees with anything we say, they're all going to jail. But the rest are more than welcome to stay and obey our commands. It was that kind of night: festive, good hearted, magnanimous. Months later as the Inauguration neared and the Biden family made its victorious procession into the capital city, the mood lifted even higher. ""I have chills,"" wrote one editor at ""The New York Times,"" she was feverish with joy. CNN rousted its Poet Laureate from lunch and led him to the set to commemorate this moment. Here's the sonnet he wrote for the occasion. DAVID CHALIAN, CNN POLITICAL DIRECTOR: Those lights that are that are just shooting out from the Lincoln Memorial along the reflecting pool. I look -- it's like almost extensions of Joe Biden's arms embracing America. CARLSON: Not everyone is as poetic as David Chalian, the man you just saw. That's why he is CNN's political director. An ordinary journalist might not even have noticed that Joe Biden's arms are like twin beams of light shooting forth from the reflecting pool, embracing America as a mother embraces a child. No, an ordinary journalist might simply have described Joe Biden's arms as toned and tawny and redolent of musk and saddle leather. Not everyone is David Chalian. But not everyone needs to be David Chalian. The thing about journalism is, it's not an individual achievement. It's about the group. In journalism, it is the collective spirit that matters, like synchronized swimmers or certain species of insects, journalists move together in concert as a herd, if you will. When Joe Biden writes a talking point, they repeat it, not just a few of them, but all of them in precisely the same way. Think of reporters as the North Korean gymnastics team celebrating Kim Il- sung day in a soccer stadium in Pyongyang, they move as one. Watch this clip, for example, members of the Press Corps inform you that this new group of politicians in Washington is very different from any other group of politicians in all of human history. Unlike the rest of them, these people are committed to something called the truth. LEMON: President Joe Biden making it clear his administration will be nothing like his predecessor's with a focus on truth, science and transparency. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A commitment to clarity, transparency, science and truth. POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: ... a return to normalcy as the Biden administration vows truth and transparency now. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: As the Biden White House vows transparency and truth when sharing information with the American people, what does that mean? We're going to talk about it. BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: As this White House promises to bring truth and science back to the White House. MIKA BRZEZINSKI, MSNBC HOST: ... is getting back to the truth and valuing the truth. CARLSON: Getting back to the truth, valuing the truth. Now, there's a refreshing concept. Who does that remind you of, by the way? We are not being patriarchal here, but if we're being totally honest, that sounds a lot like dad. A little blunt sometimes, but honest, a straight shooter. Solid, reliable, steady. That's Joe Biden. Above all, Joe Biden is a family man, he took the train back to Wilmington every night to the 10,000 square foot estate a campaign donor bought from an exchange for unregistered lobbying on behalf of credit card companies. Biden is not like the last guy. Joe Biden's family is refreshingly normal. There aren't any weird sex scandals or protracted drug problems or ongoing criminal investigations you've got to worry about. You want to know what the Bidens are doing this weekend? A recent headline in ""Newsweek"" will tell you quote: ""Joe Biden wins in Mario Kart race against granddaughter at Camp David."" It's wholesome stuff like that, not secretly lobbying for China, not impregnating strippers from Arkansas. No, they're playing Mario Kart with the grandkids just like you. And at the heart of this great American family is a love story. One man, one woman in the fires of passion that changed the course of our history. Not since Anthony dining with Cleopatra in downtown Antioch before they killed themselves obviously, has a country witnessed a love story as moving and poignant as Jill and Joe's. No, ladies and gentlemen, Jill Biden is not Joe's caretaker. She isn't his nurse. She is his fully equal romantic partner. Together they are like besotted teens, yet at the same time, they are the wise and knowing parents of a nation as the headline from POLITICO on Valentine's Day put it quote: ""Historians and relationship experts agree, the first couple's romantic gestures aren't just genuine -- they're restorative."" So it's official. The Biden's affection is totally real. It's in no way part of a slick PR campaign devised by cynical consultants determined to hide the President's senility by misdirection. Not at all. Their love is as real as climate change. The POLITICO story begins this way, quote: ""On a mission to rebuild institutional norms and help heal a hurting nation, Joe and Jill Biden are trying something novel after four years of the Trumps: a little tenderness."" That's right America, a little tenderness. The Bidens' love is like medicine. It's more powerful than the COVID vaccine and you only need one injection. Watch Dr. Joy Reid prescribe a whole lot more of it. JOY REID, MSNBC HOST: What a story though. What a great love story between Jill Biden and Joe Biden. It's just a different kind of marriage. This is a love match, like the Obama's were, so I think that'll be healing for the country, too. CARLSON: Yes, it will be. The Bidens' love will be healing for this country. It will make us whole again. It might even stop looming hyperinflation and keep the Chinese Navy from closing the South China Sea to international shipping. That's the kind of love it is. When you've got a love like that, it emits a magnetic tug. People can feel it. They seek you out like pilgrims to bask in your healing rays. Here was the scene on the White House lawn just this weekend as reporters from across the region threw down their crutches and approached America's reigning apostle of love, hoping to graze the hem of his garment and be healed. QUESTION: How do you extend that love story to the American people that are feeling so down right now? So discouraged? JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Tell them there is hope, there's hope. You just have to stay strong. DR. JILL BIDEN, FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES: It's lifted your spirits. JOE BIDEN: I hope you didn't have to come out this early in this morning, it's so damn cold. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Next time bring us coffee, too? JOE BIDEN: That's true, I wasn't sure you would all be here. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We will be here. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I love your dogs. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'll bring the doughnuts next Friday if you come back. JOE BIDEN: Okay. I'll tell you what, I apologize. Here, I did not taste. I didn't even -- I didn't even have a taste. Here, come on. I promise you. I have not -- UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I am going to get in trouble. I don't have my mask. JOE BIDEN: I give you my word. I didn't have any of it. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well, thank you. I appreciate it. JOE BIDEN: Okay. CARLSON: I'll bring doughnuts. I love your dog. And above all, how can your love heal this nation? We don't know the answer to that question. We're not Brit Hume. Brit Hume has been in journalism for more than 50 years. He knows love. That's why he is our senior political correspondent here at FOX. He joins us now to assess the steamy relationship between our news media and their hot new boyfriend, Joe Biden. So Brit, I watched you and I don't want to date anybody, but I watched you literally, as a kid cover our Federal government from the Congress, from the White House lawn, and I never heard you once ask any politician how that person's love story was going to heal a nation. How do you assess questions like that? BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, it is gushing coverage and it's something that when I was coming along as a reporter, you -- no matter how you personally felt about a politician, favorably or unfavorably, you just didn't introduce that or show it and you certainly never gushed. And when a politician was promising all kinds of wonderful things, you never announced that they were going to achieve them. What you said was that they said they were going to achieve them. And you said that -- you kept distance. You didn't make their opinions and statements your own. You kept a distance. It was -- and this was a set of customs, not so much of objectivity -- nobody is really capable of that -- but of neutrality in which you approach everything and you disciplined yourself as a journalist, not to allow your personal feelings to infect your coverage. You kept your distance. And what I think has happened, Tucker, over the past several decades is that journalists have collectively, the press collectively always had power. We discovered during Watergate how much power individual reporters could have, you know, two reporters in ""The Washington Post"" did very good reporting, by the way that ultimately led to the downfall of a President, a hated President, a President, particularly, you know, he was a Republican and basically a conservative hated by the media, and they found that they had this power, and they've been itching to exercise it in any way they could ever since. And then along came Donald Trump and the press has really accelerated because journalists took the view, it was consonant with their own personal views, that this man's presence in the White House was a national emergency. And the old restraints were completely abandoned and we had this headlong pursuit of the story that ended up having nothing to it really about Russia collusion, but it looked so much like the kind of story that could bring a President down, they couldn't resist. In the meantime, something else, Tucker, has happened, I think. And that is that the country has grown so big that, you know, advertisers turn to newspapers because they want the biggest possible audience. But nowadays, if you only have a niche audience, in a country this big, it can be big enough so that you have something advertisers want. And then on top of that, there's this, ""The New York Times"" is the best example of it. ""The New York Times"" is increasingly turning to advertising, I mean to revenue from subscriptions, people buy these online subscriptions, it's worked very well. It is doing -- ""The Times"" is doing very well with it. But now instead of being beholden to advertisers, which was never really much of a problem, these journalists are beholden to their subscribers, and therefore subscribers, if you're ""The New York Times,"" they're on the left. So they get -- those readers get a steady diet of just what they want. CARLSON: I just think though and I understand all of that and I think that's a really smart analysis of what undergirds a lot of these trends. But you've got to think at the level of the individual reporter if you find yourself on a Sunday at your computer typing out a story that begins, ""Joe and Jill Biden's love will heal this nation"" that your self-respect is going to be offended. You've got to think to yourself, you know, I'm not anybody's flunky. You know, like, I'm not going to rewrite a press release for some politician. People don't seem to feel that way anymore. They're happy to. HUME: Well, I think one of the things that the Watergate era and I repeat, Watergate was good reporting. The story was real. But I think what that era ushered into journalism was a lot of people who wanted to exercise power. And, you know, they came in, they had a side and they took the side. And so you get this -- you know, you get this really harsh coverage of Donald Trump. It was really no effort in mainstream media to treat him fairly to report on the things that he did that illustrated his faults, which are legion, but gosh, at the same time, you know, the things that he had accomplished and report, you know, what the results were. And that didn't happen. I think it's just because reporters now are activists using journalism to advance their own political agendas. CARLSON: That's for sure, and degrading them. HUME: So you end up gushing over Jill and Joe Biden, which you think would be embarrassing, but apparently not. CARLSON: You think it would be, I don't know. It's just amazing. Brit Hume, I appreciate your coming on tonight. Thank you. HUME: You bet. Thank you. CARLSON: So unbeknownst to most people, the Green New Deal came to Texas. The power grid in the state became totally reliant on windmills. Then it got cold and the windmills broke because that's what happens in the Green New Deal, you're without power. Millions are still without power tonight. Several have died. Now the same energy policies that have wrecked Texas this week are going nationwide. They are coming to your state. We'll tell you what that means just ahead. CARLSON: So Texas, big, durable, well-run place generally is still kind of a disaster tonight, a lot of people without power. The Texas Public Utility Commission says the state had very little margin of error it turns out in its energy grid. Yes. It turns out to be absolutely right. The Commission described the situation is very scary. Now, we know exactly why that margin for error was so tight -- green energy. Because politicians benefited from it, wind turbines wound up generating about a quarter of Texas's power. It got cold last night and the windmills froze, and as a result, millions of Texans are freezing, several have died. Mike Taylor knows a lot about energy. He's the owner of Combined Energy Services in the state of New York and he joins us tonight for some perspective. Mike, thanks so much for coming on. Were you surprised by what you saw happen in Texas yesterday? MIKE TAYLOR, OWNER, COMBINED ENERGY SERVICES, NEW YORK: Boy, Tucker, I was really surprised. I never would expect to see icing like that in the State of Texas. We're used to up here in upstate New York, you can see the weather. CARLSON: Yes. TAYLOR: But once I saw the destruction in Texas, the icing of the solar panels and wind turbines, I just -- you know, I look at it in our world, I can't imagine how it's going to work. CARLSON: So it seems like if the whole point of putting so called Green Energy out there is because you think the weather is volatile, maybe you would have factored that into your decision. It seems reckless -- just from a civilian standpoint, it seems kind of reckless to set aside 25 percent of your power grid for windmills. Do you think that it is? TAYLOR: Well, you know, Tucker, I don't know enough about windmills. They're not that prevalent in this area. But what I know is in New York State where 72 percent of our electric is produced from fossil fuels, and the remaining 28 percent, only five percent comes from solar panels or wind. So when New York State's New Green initiatives they have on the table phasing in over the next 30 years, very hard within nine, I don't really see how we're going to increase that number to ever make it work. The disaster we saw in Texas, I think, is nothing compared to what's going to happen here if we try to just rely on those alternative energies, I think we need a commonsense mix. And I believe things have been improving drastically over the years, but we just can't flip the switch as fast as I think people would like to. CARLSON: It seems to me again, from an outsider's perspective that we've allowed lunatic ideologues who know nothing about science or engineering to have a lot of control over our power grid. Do you think that's why -- shouldn't we let engineers make decisions about how our power grid runs or no? TAYLOR: I would -- I would definitely agree with you on that one. I mean, this is proven. Our winters up in the northeast and all across the Northern United States are much more severe than they have in Texas. I can't imagine how it is going to work in the long run. We see in New York State, it is looming in the next nine years, we're not going to be able to install any fossil fuel appliances such as natural gas or propane gas or home heating oil furnace or boiler. So nine years from now, we're going to be forced to tell our customers they have to use electricity. On top of that, a lot of homes are not set up to have the amperage to allow to convert to electric. New York State, we have some of the highest electric rates in the country. So how are we going to switch from fossil fuels to a more expensive product? I just can't imagine. On top of that, Tucker, in New York State, they are proposing on the Florida State Assembly and the Senate right now carbon taxes. They want to carbon tax all our fossil fuels. So that's gasoline, diesel, natural gas, propane and home heating oil, everything. So a carbon tax on top of what the pandemic where the New York State's $15 billion budget deficit, I can't imagine how we're going to be able to do it. How can anybody afford to get to work or even heat their home? CARLSON: I mean, outside of New York City, Westchester County and the Hamptons, New York is a poor state. Drive around it and you will find that out very quickly. It's going to hurt the people there. Do you think Andrew Cuomo, always seems to be like he's doing a ""Good fellas"" imitation, but I guess he's not. Does he know a lot about home heating policy? Is he like an expert in HVAC? Or why is he weighing in in how people heat their homes? Do you have any idea? TAYLOR: You know, I can't tell you. I'm sure his home is warm in Westchester, Albany wherever he is. But the people in New York State are struggling, and if we're going to tell them that you have to remove your natural gas or propane and your heating appliances, and you have to go to electricity. And with it, that electricity has to come from clean energy, Tucker, it doesn't exist. Only five percent now comes from alternative energy. We have hydroelectric, we're not building anymore of that in New York State. So where do they think within nine years, we're going to start phasing out rapidly fossil fuels? It's unbelievable. So where these policies are coming from, I think that our elected officials in Albany are out of touch. CARLSON: Well, they're very in touch with their campaign donors who will now have a monopoly under state law for your own heating. Oh, it's perfect. I love it. Mike, I appreciate your perspective on that. Good luck. TAYLOR: Tucker, thank you for having me. CARLSON: Thank you. So the press corps has been so busy asking the Bidens about their famous love affair that no one has asked why the nation's capital remains under military occupation tonight. Why are the troops there? Why can't they go home? Why won't Speaker Pelosi tear down this wall? We'll tell you after the break. CARLSON: Donald Trump is retired from office, but last week, he got impeached. Anyway, he became the first non-President in American history to be impeached by Congress. On Saturday, as you may have seen, he was acquitted. But had he been convicted at trial, Donald Trump would have been barred from running for office forever. So the point of impeachment was to make it illegal for voters to elect Donald Trump ever again whether they wanted to or not. This we were told was necessary to defend democracy. So you can vote for anyone you want as long as permanent Washington approves of the person you're voting for. No one who challenges the political class is allowed to wield power. That's the new definition of democracy. No wonder you're hearing so much about democracy. No wonder so many in Washington supported the impeachment trial. It protected their power, and they've set a precedent. So expect more impeachments and not just to former Presidents. Over the weekend, Congresswoman Sara Jacobs of California announced that she plans to impeach the entire country. Quote, ""I think there are a lot of us who know that this impeachment trial was just the start of holding Donald Trump accountable."" Jacobs explained to CNN. ""What we need next,"" she explained, "" ... is a national impeachment,"" a so-called truth commission to punish the 74 million disobedient voters, quote, ""Because we haven't really done the reckoning with the racial injustice and white supremacy of our past that we need to do."" You probably won't be totally shocked to learn that Sara Jacobs is the child of billionaires, challenge the ruling class and Sara Jacobs will leap to her own defense denouncing you as a dangerous white supremacist, you must be punished. So if you're starting to realize that Donald Trump's impeachment wasn't really about Donald Trump, you might be onto something because it's never about what they say it's about. That's the main lesson of this moment. In May, the media commanded us to be outraged by the death of a man called George Floyd in Minneapolis. The tape they showed us was horrifying. A police officer kneeling on George Floyd's neck, George Floyd dying in the street. That officer was promptly arrested. He is awaiting trial on murder charges right now. But his arrest was hardly the end of it. The fury did not subside, it accelerated. George Floyd's death became a referendum not simply on one cop or one police department, but on all cops and all police departments and then on the United States itself. Eight months later, America has changed completely and forever. You imagine the George Floyd protests were about George Floyd and about police brutality. In fact, they were about you. Sensing a theme here? It's never about what they say it's about. Back in March, we were told the coronavirus lockdowns were an attempt to curb the coronavirus. They'd last just a short time. Almost a year later, we're starting to understand that they will never end. Over the weekend, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair endorsed the policy of issuing internal passports to the residents of Western countries. Only people who followed government vaccination orders will be allowed to travel freely. Not so long ago, Tony Blair's idea would have been dismissed out of hand as a form of Soviet social control. Today, few question it. Everyone seems to understand that authoritarianism disguised as health policy is now the rule, it's inevitable. Those temporary measures are now permanent. Surprised? You shouldn't be because it's never about what they say it is about. Just the other day to name yet another example, we learned that the arrival of the coronavirus vaccine does not, in fact mean that our schools can reopen. Indeed explained the new head of the C.D.C., Rochelle Walensky, we will need quote, ""a lot more resources in order to get the schools safe."" Those resources must include complex retrofitted ventilation systems in every American school. Why is that? In order to protect, quote, ""children with asthma for exposure to mold."" But wait a second, you may ask, what do you asthma and exposure to mold have to do with COVID-19? Well, nothing, obviously. Once again, COVID restrictions aren't just about COVID any more than Donald Trump's impeachment was just about Donald Trump, or BLM's ongoing campaign to end the nuclear family was ever about George Floyd. And only simpletons like Mitt Romney and Mitch McConnell assumed otherwise. They took it literally. No, it's not about that. It's all about changing this country forever. It's all about you. So with that in mind, you might have questions about the thousands of Federal troops who are occupying our capital city tonight. Why are they still there? The explanations from authorities keep changing. At first, you'll remember we were told that armed troops were absolutely necessary, because there was an Inauguration coming up. Well, that was almost a month ago. The ceremony came and it went and there was no violence, no evidence of any right-wing insurrectionist conspiracy afoot, and yet the troops stayed. Next, we were told the soldiers were there to protect lawmakers during impeachment. The threat from Donald Trump's voters was that profound. We needed the army. Well, impeachment is now over, but the soldiers remain. Now we've learned that troops may be staying in Washington until fall. So when will they go home? You know the answer. They'll never go home. The troops will never leave, just as the troops have never left Afghanistan or Korea or Europe. Federal troops in Washington are permanent now. They're the Praetorian Guard of our ruling class. They send the one message our leaders demand that we understand, which is, we're in charge now. We should have seen this coming. It wasn't about what they said it was about. It was about power. And once you hand them that, you never get it back. Well, the new DA in Los Angeles has decided not to enforce the law against violent criminals. One inmate in California found a way to take advantage of those new rules. We will tell you the story straight ahead. CARLSON: George Gascon is the District Attorney in Los Angeles. His job is to enforce the law. He has decided not to, including against violent criminals. One inmate in California decided to take advantage of this new policy with a phone call, an amazing story. Our Trace Gallagher has it for us tonight. Hey, Trace. TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Tucker. Daniel Avila is currently serving 140-year sentence at the State Prison in Sacramento. Avila is a career violent criminal and so-called three striker, meaning he is serving a life sentence after being convicted of three violent crimes, including attempted first degree murder of a police officer, using a deadly weapon on a police officer and a laundry list of convictions for weapons and even threatening to kill a Judge. But Daniel Avila is also doing his homework and he knows that new Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascon has said that as part of his far left criminal reform plan, he will refuse to prosecute people based on enhancements including three strikes and is planning to resentence 20,000 inmates. So Daniel Avila is currently in prison in Northern California outside of Gascon's jurisdiction, but he is about to transfer to a State Prison in Los Angeles County, and he has now devised a plan to get back into the LA County Court System. Recently, Avila shared his plan in this voicemail to the Downtown Los Angeles DA's office. He begins by saying, ""I need you to listen to this message."" That appears to be good advice. Watch. ( BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) DANIEL AVILA, CALIFORNIA INMATE: My case is subject to the new special directives under Gascon. Ninety percent of it is enhancements. I'm going to go down to Lancaster and I hate to do this, but I'm going to beat the [bleep] out of a cop when I get there when it's LA County's jurisdiction. I'm reluctant to do that, but I'm going to do what I need to do to get back into the LA County Court System. ( END AUDIO CLIP) GALLAGHER: He's going to beat up a cop. George Gascon has not yet responded to the voice message, but an LA Deputy District Attorney did respond today on ""FOX and Friends."" Watch. JON HATAMI, LA DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY: These policies are not progressive, they are not. These policies are actually dangerous and they are actually radical. They endanger law enforcement and they endanger the community. GALLAGHER: Remember, Gascon's own prosecutors sued him for trying to do away with sentencing enhancements claiming he was ignoring the law and a Judge sided with the prosecutors at least temporarily -- Tucker. CARLSON: Amazing. Trace Gallagher, thanks so much for that. GALLAGHER: Yes. CARLSON: Well, in 2019, we interviewed the Secretary of Homeland Security on this show, Kirstjen Nielsen and we asked: does the government have any idea just how many illegal aliens live in this country? Politicians have claimed for more than 10 years that there are 11 million of them. Do we really know? Watch. CARLSON: Does the U.S. government know exactly how many people are living in this country illegally? I've seen academic studies that put that number between 11 million, 22 million, maybe more. What is the real number? KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, FORMER UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY: Yes. We debate it, and I think that's accurate. CARLSON: So we don't know. NIELSEN: We question it. We do not know. CARLSON: That must be a grave concern to you that we potentially have more than 10 million people here whose identities we don't know, it could be over 20 whose identities we don't know and like they could be anybody? NIELSEN: Yes. CARLSON: And so why is that not the single most pressing problem the country has? NIELSEN: In my opinion, right now, this is one of, if not the biggest crisis this country has faced in a decade. CARLSON: So the best estimate, we have, the firmest puts the number at about 22 million people living here illegally. There are informed estimates that put number above 30 million. Anyone who repeats the 11 million number is either ignorant or lying. But today, no matter what the number is, the Biden administration committed to making every one of these foreign nationals living here illegally into a voting citizen. So we have no idea how many there are, but the Biden administration wants to introduce tens of millions of people into the labor force to compete for jobs with Americans as quickly as possible. JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Certainly, as part of the proposal that the President outlined and proposed on day one is an earned path to citizenship, right, for 11 million immigrants who are undocumented immigrants who are living in the country. CARLSON: Again, the 11 million number is a lie. Do not let it pass without questioning it. But no matter what the number is, more than 10 million new voters is going to change the political balance of this country dramatically, and it will disempower some people quite a bit. Not all of them Republicans, possibly African-American voters, if you think it through a little bit. But if you ask Congresswoman Yvette Clarke of New York, amnesty is great news for African-American voters, quote: ""This comprehensive immigration bill would give DREAMers and TPS/DED holders a pathway to citizenship. Never forget that immigration is a Black issue."" Exclamation point. She never explained what she meant by that. Of course, it's a lie and a total betrayal of her voters. Unrestricted immigration hurts all Americans, but it especially hurts people at the bottom of the income scale. According to a 2006 study by a top economist at Harvard University, immigration dramatically lowered the employment rate of African-American men and increase their incarceration rate. Those are not small things and that's not even touching on the question of political power, which is a real question. Congressman Burgess Owens joins us tonight to assess all of this. Congressman, I appreciate your coming on tonight. REP. BURGESS OWENS (R-UT): Thank you, Tucker. OWENS: I just find it absolutely amazing that labor unions and leaders of the Congressional Black Caucus could endorse something that's so obviously hurts their own members. Why do you think they're doing this? OWENS: Well, what we have to understand is what the real threat to the hard left and growing up in a remarkably successful segregated, but middle class family in the 60s and went across our country and turned his attention to the black community, the greatest threat to the left is the middle class black American, those who have faith, they have a family, they're educated, and they believe in a God and they believe in the free market. What was happened to my community, and by the way, these -- the leftist have never been our friends. They're the ones that are anti-choice. They are the ones that open borders that they know that is going to end up hurting those that are trying to get that first ladder up to the middle class. They are against anything, any policy that helps us to become independent. And that is what -- that's what the left is trying to do to our country. So I want to be the greatest warning buoy to let you know from a community that was remarkably competitive, the most competitive and our country during the 60s that is not competitive because of what the left has done. What they've done to us is a preview of what they're trying to do to our country. So we need to wake up Americans. It doesn't Democrat, Independent, Republican, it doesn't matter what party, those who love our nation knows that there's a -- they need to know there's a leftist ideology that hates everything we stand for, and they're coming at us big time. We need to pull ourselves together, start communicating and realize that the policies that Biden is putting together right now is all about defeating the dream of Americans to live the American Dream and may get to that middle class. CARLSON: I've got to ask you, Congressman, quickly, what percentage of actual black voters do you think are in favor of giving amnesty to foreign nationals here illegally, giving them voting rights and benefits? Is that super popular among black voters? OWENS: No, no. It's a very, very small minority of those who get to have a chance to have this conversation. Only the black elitist, those are the ones that have really done the most damage. Those who live the American dream, the Black Caucus right now that literally live the American Dream until the rest of us, we can't do it. They're all about doing anything they can to keep the lowest, those who are trying to get to the middle class dependent so that the elitist class gets more power. And it doesn't matter what color they are, Tucker, elitist are the worst threat to our nation, no matter what color and the worst of those who look like me and tell black Americans like myself, we can't do what other Americans do because whatever -- our skin color or whatever their excuse might be. The dream of America is we can overcome all obstacles and we can make sure we are spreading that news big time. CARLSON: It's such a betrayal, one of many, but a bad one. Congressman Owens of Utah. Great to see you tonight. Thank you. OWENS: Thank you. Thank you, Tucker. CARLSON: So you thought The Lincoln Project was vicious and creepy. Oh, so much worse than that and we're learning the details more tonight. The Lincoln Project covered up sexual harassment of minors for a long time. We've got details after the break. CARLSON: The Lincoln Project funded heavily by tech oligarchs was one of the nastiest, most destructive political enterprises this country has ever seen. Now, it is collapsing in shame. But so far, and this is interesting, The Lincoln Project has escaped any real accountability for what it did. Some of the things it did may have been criminal. One of the founders of The Lincoln Project, Steve Schmidt appeared on television last week. He didn't apologize for working for an organization that covered up the sexual harassment of minors, harassment he apparently knew was going on. Instead, he called for shooting people, specifically the Chewbacca guy at the Capitol on January 6th. Watch this. STEVE SCHMIDT, COFOUNDER, THE LINCOLN PROJECT: You know, I think the most amazing thing about the whole thing is watching the video and on the Senate floor, there's a cop who is armed and a guy bursts in, the QAnon Shaman dressed like a Viking and he basically talks to him. You're -- I'm watching -- shoot him, shoot him, like if you burst into the United States Senate, if he was dressed like bin Laden, would you have shot him? CARLSON: Shoot him? For standing in the United States Capitol? We were against people breaking in the Capitol and said it 20 times. But if you watch the tape of the guy with the Viking horns and your first instinct is shoot him, kill him, take his life. You're sick. There's really something wrong with you. Shoot him? And people applauded. What the hell is this? There's something going on here. Julie Kelly is with ""American Greatness."" She thought about it and she joins us tonight to tell us what she has discovered. Julie, thanks so much. So leaving aside the tape we just played, which is really disturbing, I think. It is very clear The Lincoln Project people knew that John Weaver was soliciting sex from children and others, and they hid that fact. How are they getting away with that? JULIE KELLY, SENIOR CONTRIBUTOR, ""AMERICAN GREATNESS"": Well, because they like all never-Trump organizations are useful idiots for the left. It's important to know that The Lincoln Project even though they portray themselves as conservatives are far from it. The $90 million that they've raked in over a one-year period all comes from the left, top Democratic donors. In fact, their top donor is the Senate Majority PAC, $2 million went from the Senate Democratic top PAC into The Lincoln Project. And so -- but Tucker, you know this because you've dealt with these people, you've been targeted by them. The Lincoln Project is everything that is wrong with American politics right now. You just saw that clip from Steve Schmidt. Not only have they burned every campaign that they've ever worked on from John McCain's to Mitt Romney's to John Kasich's, they just are toxic people who have nothing to offer, nothing of value, no new policy ideas. They just spew venom constantly and so their demise is overdue and welcome. CARLSON: I mean, I know Steve Schmidt. You know, I always got along with him, but shoot him? Who would say something -- if you start calling for shooting people. I mean, that's kind of a different level. That's not political rhetoric. That's something really ugly, don't you think? Or, I guess, it is pretty obvious. KELLY: No, I mean. He is a very unhinged individual and you saw kind of this disclosure that he made about some abuse that he suffered, apparently as a teenager. And, you know, this is why he is so distraught over what he found out about John Weaver. But John Weaver is one of the worst kept secrets in Washington, D.C. Karl Rove just said a few weeks ago, so, but look, they've lawyered up, and now they're turning on each other. And so this is one of the upsides of 2021 because these people should be routed from American politics forever and humiliated which they now are. CARLSON: Yes. And anyone who fantasize about violence like that should go take some time, get off the stage. Julie, great to see you. Thank you. KELLY: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: We'll be back tomorrow night at 8:00 p.m. We can't wait for that. In the meantime, Sean Hannity takes over from New York. Classification"
2021-01-19,"TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening, and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. It's weird to say it, but this is the last day of the Trump administration. If you supported Donald Trump, that's a sad thing to face after four years. On the other hand, if you didn't support Donald Trump, if you're one of the many in our professional class who have made hating Donald Trump the very center of your life, this has got to be a pretty good day for you. You won. Your party now has control of everything. By tomorrow afternoon, Donald Trump will be gone for good. You've got exactly what you wanted. You should be thrilled about that. You ought to be celebrating. But they're not celebrating. That's the remarkable thing. No one in the Democratic Party seems happy tonight. They're angrier than ever. Instead of taking victory laps, they are plotting revenge against the people they just beat. They are thinking of new ways to injure and humiliate and degrade their political opponents, make it impossible for them to work again. Throw them in jail, destroy their lives. It's hard to describe how weird and strange and awful this is to watch. Imagine winning a tennis match in straight sets then immediately leaping over the net and smashing your opponent in the face with your racket. It wasn't enough for you to win, you had to inflict physical pain. You couldn't be happy until another human being screamed in agony. What kind of person would do that? Well, the kind of people we're watching now, the kind of people who are even more vicious when they win. The leaders the Democratic Party have now decided that 74 million Trump voters weren't just wrong or misguided. They didn't simply back the wrong guy or have incorrect opinions or failed to see the obvious truths. No. The threat they pose is graver and more serious than that, more dangerous. These 74 million Trump voters are in fact, terrorists. They are a looming physical threat to the rest of us and we must deal with them in the way that you deal with threats like that, existential threats to the nation. Saddam Hussein, al Baghdadi, Kim Jong-un, Donald Trump's voters. For years they told us this country have been infiltrated by Russian spies. But now we know it's worse than that. The real threat, the actual enemy is within. In the end, it always is. Seventy four million deviationists lurk in our midst. They look like normal people. But, ladies and gentlemen, do not be deceived. They are Trotskyites, they are wreckers, kulaks. We must root them out. It'll take a war to do that, an actual war, a war on our own people. To make that point as clear as possible, the Democratic Party has marshaled military leaders to deliver the news. They're the party spokesman now. General Stanley McChrystal is among them. McChrystal, in case you don't remember, is the strategic genius who can take credit if you can call it that, for running the longest losing war in American history, the one in Afghanistan, the war that's still going. Yesterday, McChrystal took a break from collecting fat Corporate Directors fees to note that, based on his extensive experience of mismanaging America's foreign policy, Trump voters look an awful lot like terrorists an awful lot. Quote, ""I did see a similar dynamic in the evolution of al Qaeda in Iraq."" McChrystal said, "" ... where a whole generation of angry Arab youth with very poor prospects followed a powerful leader who promised to take them back to a time to a better place. And he led them to embrace an ideology that justified their violence. This is now happening in America."" Al Qaeda in America. Thanks, Stan. Sometime when you can manage your spare moment from getting rich from your failures in America's decline, we'd love to know exactly what did happen in Afghanistan. What went wrong there? When you have time. Until then, though, Andy McCabe would like to put a finer point on the matter. You remember Andy McCabe. He is the former high level F.B.I. official who was canned for lying and corruption, a model Federal employee. So when Andy McCabe speaks, you could hear the moral authority in his voice gravelly and resonant like cigarette smoke, you're going to want to listen carefully to what Andy McCabe has to say. According to Andy McCabe's considered judgment, Donald Trump's voters are very much like ISIS. Listen to this. ANDREW MCCABE, CNN SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: When we looked at those Americans who traveled to Syria for the purpose of joining the Islamic State, when you put all those faces and names down in one place, you had doctors, lawyers -- some people are very vulnerable to and drawn into that -- that core lie of any extremist movement and that is exactly what we're seeing now with this particular group of Trump supporters. CARLSON: Wait. American national security official Andy McCabe is telling us they are like ISIS. Islamic State in Syria? Aren't those the wild eyed lunatics who beheaded journalists and set all of those people on fire and then videotaped themselves doing it? That's terrifying. That's right, Mr. and Mrs. America. What we didn't tell you before was that ISIS was for Donald Trump. That's why they are murdering so many people. They were the Syrian branch of MAGA. You may have heard it was some kind of Islamic thing. Come on. That's racist. It was Donald Trump all along. Now those people are in this country, in Dallas and Sarasota and Newport Beach, everywhere. They're hiding in plain sight. God knows what they will do next. Actually, we do know. Another 9/11. That's what they're planning. And that's why we need a new 9/11 Commission to root them out. But thankfully, Commander Pelosi is planning one right now. Watch. REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): There is strong interest in the Congress in a 9/11 type Commission. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: ... a deep look in a 9/11-style commission to really get to all of what happened. WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: Yes, they need a 9/11 type Commission of Inquiry. MCCABE: Along the lines of a 9/11 Commission. SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT): A 9/11 type Commission. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And hopefully an independent 9/11 style Commission will look at -- JAMES COMEY, FORMER F.B.I. DIRECTOR: I think this is a big enough threat, an attack on the center of our democracy that is going to need to look -- that spans branches of government something closer to a 9/11 Commission. CARLSON: Well, I think we know they're on the same e-mail chain, but that doesn't change the substance of what they just told you. Did you hear Jim Comey and other noted moral authority? What Jim Comey told you is that what happened in Washington on January 6, the Chewbacca guy stumbling on the House floor and all of it. That was this generation's 9/11. And in fact, the magnitude of that atrocity begs for a better name. So from now on, we're going to call it 1/06, that they will live in infamy for all time. Your grandchildren will get the day off from school every January 6th, in remembrance of the horror that took place. In fact, here's a better idea. Let's call it Insurrection Day, because honestly, that's what it was. REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): The President incited an insurrection against Congress to prevent the peaceful transition of power. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And then he sat back and watched the insurrection. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Insurrection, a violent mob. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A white supremacist President who incited a white supremacist insurrection. REP. ILHAN OMAR (D-MN): An insurrection against our government. REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): The violent attack on the U.S. Capitol was an act of insurrection. PELOSI: The insurrection that violated the sanctity of the people's Capitol. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This was not a protest. This was an insurrection. CARLSON: Bruce Willis in Insurrection Day. But it's not a joke. According to the honorable Jim McGovern, and everyone else you just saw on the screen, this was not a protest. How dare you call it that? This was an insurrection. Insurrection. Insurrection. Insurrection. Write that a hundred times in the board and don't forget it I-N-S-U-R-R-E- C-T-I-O-N. Insurrection. Learn it. Love it. But you should also know by the way for frame of reference what an insurrection is not. For example, yesterday 28 people arrested in a violent protest in New York, not on behalf of Donald Trump. Those people attacked police officers, a bunch of them went to jail. But know this, were they insurrecting at the time? No, they weren't. How do we know they weren't? Because they weren't racist. Only racist can insurrect. Listen carefully to Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley explain. REP. AYANNA PRESSLEY (D-MA): The threat of white supremacy looms large, and it is tragic that it took this insurrection and this attempt to interrupt the peaceful transfer of power. And moreover, injury and loss of life for many to appreciate just how formidable the threat of white supremacy is. CARLSON: This is a tough one. So what do you do with insurrectionists like that? Insurrections who are also white supremacists, as they always are, but not and here's the tricky part, in some cases, even white. So you have non-white white supremacist who interact that's very tough. How do you handle them? Simple force doesn't always work. These are hard cases. You need to re-educate people like that, possibly in camps, reeducation camps, if you will. You must deprogram them for the safety of the rest of us. Thankfully, Sandy Cortez has been thinking about this for quite some time, indeed, since she was a child growing up in leafy Westchester County. Some little girls play with dolls, but Sandy Cortez put her Barbies in a secure enclosure and reeducated them because they were thinking bad things, forbidden things. So Sandy Cortez knows exactly what to do now. REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): We had a program addressing white supremacists that -- we have programs, Federal programs that went towards funding organizations like these that de-radicalize people, and President Trump pulled the plug on Federal funding for some of these programs. And so one thing that we know is that we have to get that funding right back up and we probably need to double, triple, quadruple or increase funding for these de-radicalization programs. CARLSON: Bad Barbie. Bad Barbie. Bad Barbie. Those are naughty thoughts. This Federal program will deprogram you. So you listen to that and all of this and you realize the totalitarian instinct is always the same. Always. Only the names of the dictators change. First you strip people of their right to speak out loud, honestly. Then you prevent them from defending themselves and their families. And then because you now can, you force them at gunpoint to read your catechism, to accept your orthodoxy. You wonder if Sandy Cortez plans to make Trump voters sign written statements affirming they have been deprogrammed. Of course. That's always part of the process. The scary thing is that's where we're heading. Sandy Cortez and her friends are no longer a fringe element within the Democratic Party. Joe Biden ran as a moderate people, voted for him because they thought he was. But Joe Biden's victory was really a victory for Sandy Cortez and that part of the Democratic Party. They are closer now than they've ever been to taking control. The reason for that is very simple. There is a massive power vacuum at the center of this incoming administration, the one that takes power tomorrow. Joe Biden is fading. That is not a personal attack on Joe Biden. It is real. Joe Biden is not capable of running the government or pushing back against the radicals in his party. The people around Joe Biden know this very well and that includes people very close to him, including his relatives. People who love Joe Biden were upset when he ran for President. They know he can't do the job, and they are very worried about what happens next. That is not speculation. They have said so out loud, and no honest person in Joe Biden's orbit will deny this. So the question is: who will fill the power vacuum within the Biden administration? There are still and we're being as honest as we can be. There are still reasonable people within the Democratic Party. There are people who have a stake in this country, people who don't want to destroy it. And now is the time for those people, the reasonable people in the Democratic Party to step up forcefully and call off the war their party is planning on millions of fellow Americans, and it is war their planet. A 9/11 Commission, blanket censorship, mass arrests, deprogramming. These are not subtle indicators. These are fire alarms, and everyone can see them. No one seems to care at the moment. In the last week, CNN and ""The Washington Post"" have called for FOX News to be shut down by force. Why? Because they don't like our views, so we should be banned. In a normal country, reasonable people, including other journalists might stand up and say, hold on. Censorship is wrong. Censorship only serves the powerful. But they've said nothing because they agree. Meanwhile, our elected officials become openly authoritarian and no one pushes back. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said she would like the National Guard to place crew served machine guns, belt fed 50 cows around the city. This in addition to 26,000 Federal troops, more than Abraham Lincoln had defending the Capitol in 1864. But we need those she said, because Trump voters are that dangerous. What are the massive infrastructure professional libertarians in Washington say to this? Nothing. They were silent. What did Mitch McConnell say? The Republican leader of the Senate? Nothing. He was too busy attacking Trump voters for being the real threat. Other Members of Congress on the other side just tore up the mask completely and launched into open race hate on television. That's not an exaggeration. We wish it was. Here's Congressman Jamaal Bowman, explaining that the real problem with this country is white people. They're the threat to progress. REP. JAMAAL BOWMAN (D-NY): But this is a chance for all of us in Congress to sort of begin at a new baseline and stop spreading the myth of American exceptionalism and accept the fact that this is exactly who we are, and this is exactly who we have been throughout our country's history. Whenever there's social progress, there's white backlash. CARLSON: The story here is not that one Member of Congress said this on television. The story is that many Members of Congress and members of our media say this on television every single day, attack huge groups of Americans on the basis of their skin color and nobody says anything. Nobody pushes back as if there are no consequences to talking that way, but there are. How long can people keep talking like that and keep acting like this? Irresponsibly? Crazily? Before something breaks? Before one of those 74 million hunted terrorist Trotskyite wreckers we keep hearing about become so overwrought and paranoid from watching demagogues like Jamaal Bowman attack him on MSNBC that he does something truly awful that can't be taken back and then the cycle accelerates radically and an awful lot of people get hurt. That's where this is going. Everyone knows that that's where this will go. Until and unless someone responsible within the Democratic Party appears and puts a stop to it, and soon. It's time for the victors to accept their victory, to forgive the team they beat and to move on. You won. Be happy. Now improve the country you inherited. Tom Cotton is a senator from the State of Arkansas. He's a member of the Republican Party, and we're happy to have him on tonight. Senator Cotton, I appreciate your coming on, having trouble getting Republican senators to appear on this topic. Here's the question: you are seeing -- and this is not paranoia -- if anything, I'm trying to restrain our analysis of this because I don't want to make it worse. But you're seeing former military leaders like Stan McChrystal compare 74 million Americans to terrorists. That has massive implications. Where is this going? And how can we stop it? SEN. TOM COTTON (R-AR): Tucker, thanks for having me on. That kind of rhetoric and the rhetoric you've cited throughout your opening statement there is obviously exaggerated and overheated and it needs to stop now. As you say, it's a striking contrast. The Democrats are being very sore winners. Joe Biden is going to take office tomorrow. The Democrats have narrow majorities in the Congress, yet they seem so angry and aggressive towards the 74 million people who voted for the President. I think there's a couple reasons for that, Tucker. One, they know their agenda is massively unpopular. The American people don't want to open our borders or defund our police. And they know that politics and government is the one place where those 74 million Americans have something like an equal voice. Democrats and liberals, as you say, control our media, they control business increasingly. They control Big Tech, they control education. Politics and government is the one place where conservatives can have their voice heard. So what the Democrats want to do is use their narrow and probably fleeting majority, to try to silence all opposition to things like opening our borders for 15 million illegal aliens and probably more in the surge we see coming, while also radically changing the rules of our democracy, doing things like eliminating the filibuster and making Washington, D.C. a state and nationalizing our voting laws, so they can turn that narrow, fleeting majority into a large and permanent majority. And I for one, Tucker, is not going to going to stand for either one of those things. CARLSON: Here is my worry, though. And I'll just admit it out loud. I am worried about the reaction against this from people who I agree with politically, probably vote the same way I do. No one is defending them and they are watching television. They're hearing the most powerful people in the world describe them as terrorists and announce a war on them. And then they look to the other side in the foolish old frauds like Mitch McConnell railing on about how terrible Trump's voters are. I mean, I get it. I was against what happened to the Capitol, very against it. I said it every night. But who is the person who is going to stand up and reassure these voters that they're not going to be crushed? They're really scared right now. They have every reason to be scared. And if they stay scared, they're going to do something crazy. So why won't anyone defend them? COTTON: Tucker, I'll stand up for them and defend them tonight. Seventy four million Americans ought not to be slandered based on the action of a couple of thousand who participated in a violent mob in the Capitol two weeks ago. And because a violent mob attacked the Capitol two weeks ago, that doesn't mean that they should have their views censored, it doesn't mean they should be at risk of losing their job or having their business boycotted, losing their slots in high schools or colleges that choose selectively. It doesn't mean that they should have to pay higher taxes or open their borders or defund their police. That is crazy and it is a complete non sequitur. But the Democrats realize that that agenda is unpopular, but they also have all the other commanding heights of our society, from the media, to education, to entertainment, in their corner. What those people need, what those 74 million people who voted for the President, voted for Republicans need are Republicans and conservatives in the Congress, in the state legislatures to stand up for their rights. And I promise you, I will do that. CARLSON: Man, I'm grateful to hear that. But you know, you see Stan McChrystal, I just wonder, and I'm not saying he's evil, but I just wonder if he understands the damage that he does to the country. When as the commanding officer in Afghanistan has got the respect of all these people, he compares tens of millions of American citizens, including veterans, by the way to terrorists. Like what does that do? What damage does that do? What -- does he not realize that? COTTON: Well, it's incredibly ill-advised to take that kind of language towards the 74 million people that voted for Republicans last fall. It is polarizing as incendiary, and the Democrats as you say, ought not to go down that path. They ought to stop proposing a Truth Commission with far reaching mandates or censorship or deprogramming or any of the other radical ideas they have. How about talking about getting more vaccinations out to people? Or helping people get back to work? CARLSON: Yes, this is going to get super crazy if they don't pull back. I really am worried about it. Senator, I appreciate you coming on tonight. Thank you. COTTON: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: President's last day in office. His power to pardon ends very soon. We are expecting a bunch of pardons from the President. We're going to find out in moments who will get one and who won't. We're also discovering what's going on behind the scenes in that process. We will bring the whole thing to you after the break. CARLSON: Things are changing really fast in some of America's biggest and oldest cities. First, a lot of people left because of the COVID lockdown, so a lot of businesses shut down, too. But then something unexpected that didn't need to happen, happened. Crime went up dramatically in a lot of places: murders, rapes, armed robberies. Why did that happen? It happened because people made it happen. George Soros in a lot of cases paid for prosecutors to win elections who didn't enforce the law and the result is a lot of suffering. In Philadelphia, for example, a carjacker recently got out of jail and then promptly murdered a man who was walking his dog, really for no reason, shot him on the street. Trace Gallagher has details of this awful story -- Trace. TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF BREAKING NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Tucker, Philadelphia Police say 25-year-old Milan Loncar was walking his dog around 7:00 p.m. when two men approached him, robbed him and one of the men shot him point blank in the chest. The crime was caught on surveillance video and the suspects were picked up two hours later. The man who police say pulled the trigger is now identified as 20-year-old Josephus Davis. In 2019, Davis was arrested for robbing an Uber driver. While he was in jail, he was also charged with two previous crimes, kidnapping and assault. But after Davis had numerous hearings delayed or canceled for various reasons, Philadelphia Judge Charles Hayden lowered his bail in the assault case from $200,000.00 to $12,000.00. Judge Teresa Carr Deni then lowered the kidnapping bail from $100,000.00 to $20,000.00. Davis only needed to post 10 percent, so for 3,200 bucks, he was free. Ten days later, Milan Loncar was dead. Here's his family.  JELENA LONCAR, MILAN LONCAR' S SISTER: It's just a slap in the face on top of everything else. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Everybody loved him. Everybody is hurt by this. GALLAGHER: Philadelphia's far left district attorney, Larry Krasner blames too many guns. Critics say the true blame should be on Krasner's policies, primarily his refusal to get tough on criminals and his mandate to get tough on cops. Back in 2017, billionaire liberal donor George Soros spent nearly $1.7 million to help Krasner win his Democratic primary. Today, Philadelphia crime is skyrocketing. In the past three days, 15 and 17-year-old boys were shot and killed, a 13-year-old boy shot and badly wounded -- Tucker. CARLSON: Trace Gallagher, thanks so much. So in last night's show and on previous shows, we've told you about the cases of two men, Julian Assange and John Kiriakou. Julian Assange is a kind of international journalist, John Kiriakou is a former C.I.A. officer. We should be totally blunt and tell you we're not sure we share the politics of either man. But both of their cases tell you something really important about what's going on in this country, about what matters and about what the people in charge would like to prevent you from doing. Julian Assange and John Kiriakou both went to jail for telling the truth. Neither one stole classified documents from the U.S. government, neither one of them hacked into anything. Julian Assange told you a lot about what the U.S. government was doing abroad and told you everything about what the D.N.C. was doing to rig its own primaries back in 2016. Remember the WikiLeaks dump? You know about that because of Julian Assange. And by the way, if you're a Bernie Sanders voter, assuming anyone is watching tonight, you probably were glad to know that. Everyone else was lying to you. Julian Assange brought you information that you had a right to know. John Kiriakou, meanwhile, told the truth about what our military and our Intel agencies were doing during the Iraq War. Again, you may not agree with his position, but what he said was true. And that matters, above all, because truth is and must be a defense. If you say something true, you shouldn't be punished, because we should value truth above all. In both cases, those men went to prison. And in both cases tonight, as one of his final acts as President, Donald Trump has the opportunity to make that right, to pardon both of them. We told you that last time, we told you before. We're hearing tonight, that neither man, particularly Julian Assange, we don't know if this is true, isn't likely to get a pardon. Why? Well, apparently because Republicans in the Senate and by Republicans in the Senate, we mean Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the leader of Republicans in the Senate, has sent word over to the White House. If you pardon Julian Assange, we are much more likely to convict you in an impeachment trial. Now, is it legal to hold that over a President's head? We're not lawyers, we don't know. It's certainly wrong. But more than that, it tells you everything about their priorities. At a time when this country in some ways is coming apart. We're at a pivot point in American history, and if you're watching this show, you probably feel pretty threatened and for good reason. There are people on the other channel saying they're going to hunt you down like a terrorist. At that moment, what is Mitch McConnell, your designated defender in the United States Senate worrying about? He is worrying about protecting the uni-party in Washington, not his party, his party and the Democratic Party in permanent Washington. They're the reason both these men have been locked up. Because both these men embarrassed permanent Washington, that's their crime. And his priority, in the final hours of the Trump administration, is to make certain that they remain punished for doing that. It tells you everything. We don't know what's going to happen in the end. We've got a number of hours left for the President to make that decision. But we want you to know how that decision is being made. Because it's deeply revealing. HR departments love sending e-mails about what a horrible country this is and how racist you are. Last week, one man decided he'd had enough of that because it's not true. And why would you put up with it if it's not true? So he responded to his boss with a video message and he didn't hold back. One of the bravest college professors in America joins us after the break. CARLSON: So in case you haven't noticed, school administrators and HR Departments almost everywhere have developed a new fixation over the past year. They're sending you a lot of e-mails about equity, not equality, equity, which is very different, and anti-racism, which is not decency. It's very different from that, too. And of course, how evil this country is, how could you live here? You probably got a lot of those e-mails and thought yourself, well, this is divisive and wrong. But you want to keep earning a paycheck. In fact, you have to because you have a mortgage, so you shut up about it. Most people do. Last week, one man didn't. A Law Professor in New Mexico State University called David Clements got one of those e-mails from his boss, the President of the University. According to the University's President, those BLM and Antifa riots you saw all last year, the ones that leveled our cities are not a big deal, but the MAGA insurrection at the Capitol was a crisis of historic proportions. So to his credit, Professor Clements did not delete that e-mail. He didn't ignore it. He decided to speak up for everyone else who was too afraid to speak. DAVID CLEMENTS, LAW PROFESSOR, NEW MEXICO STATE UNIVERSITY: But what happened this past Wednesday is not being categorized as a riot with an angry people that have every right to be angry. It's being called insurrection. They're being called an angry mob, demagogues. So first of all, I'm offended that this is the e-mail that you're going to send to faculty, when you've been largely silent as cities have burned, people have lost their businesses, homes. CARLSON: So Professor Clements is not a demagogue. He's not even especially political. He says in the video actually didn't even vote for Trump in 2016. He thought of himself as a never Trumper. But a lot changed over four years, including his mind, and he did vote for Trump in 2020. But whatever. It doesn't matter who he voted for. He was saying obvious truths that most people can't say, so we wanted to talk to him, and a moment ago, we just did. ( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CARLSON: You know what's going to happen when you talk like this in public, when you express yourself, as you would have say even five years ago, but you did it anyway. Why? CLEMENTS: Well, in part because it appears that the university is under a spell of Marxism. Twenty percent of the faculty members out there identify proudly as Marxist. And so what I'm asking for is parity. If you're going to call out violence, call it out. But do it year round. Don't just wait until it's politically convenient, due to what happened this past Wednesday. And in part because my students have expressed the same fears that they can't share who they really are at the university. Faculty members have contacted me by the hundreds saying that this is not just a local issue here in New Mexico, but it's pervasive everywhere. And so, right now what I'm dealing with are students that are enamored with Critical Race Theory and all of these doctrines that seem to condemn America. They seem to condemn what we stand for and the miracle that this country is, and instead, we're glorifying doctrines out of Communist China and it's clear for anyone that wants to look for it. CARLSON: Professor, I agree with everything you've said. I think most Americans, regardless of party would agree with what you said. But you know, for a fact that the administration of the school you work for, your employers violently disagree with what you said. Are you saying this with the full knowledge that your life is about to become much more difficult? CLEMENTS: Yes, I don't have tenure. I'm on the tenure track. So it's even riskier for me. But the fact remains that before I was a professor, I was a prosecutor. And I didn't live in an ivory tower. I didn't live in abstraction. I looked at the facts around me and I had to represent victims of violent crimes. And I didn't leave that when I came and became a professor. And while it may be academically expedient to just talk about these theories, they have real world consequences. And my students are in the throes of depression. They're despondent. And they are afraid to speak. And it really doesn't matter whether I voted for Trump or Biden, I'm not going to treat my students differently based on who they voted for. But they need to know, when they get into my classroom, they're going to be treated fairly, they're going to be taught to think critically. They're not going to be told what to think. And there's just an absence of that going on in our university system right now. And it's worth speaking up about, if I don't, I'm complicit. CARLSON: Man, you are brave. I mean, you are calm and you're reasonable, and you're articulate, they have to pull you off the stage. They absolutely have to. And I hope when they try, you will come back and tell us about it. Because if one man can speak up as you have, it makes a massive difference, I think in the life of the country. So I appreciate your doing it. CLEMENTS: Thank you, Tucker. ( END VIDEOTAPE) CARLSON: Joe Biden has just named his appointee who will oversee your healthcare. The point is not to improve your healthcare, it's to insult you. This nominee has admitted she is not very good at her job and that's demonstrably true. Why aren't journalists reporting on this? How can they sleep at night ignoring it? We will tell you what happened. Who this person is and what it may mean for you, after the break. CARLSON: Joe Biden has just announced he will nominate Rachel Levine to be as Assistant Secretary for Health. Now, you're supposed to be excited about that because the incoming administration describes Levine as the first quote, ""openly transgender federal appointee."" So there's that. But what matters is Rachel Levine's qualifications and work history. Levine was Pennsylvania Secretary of Health, the details of that tenure are less reassuring. Last year, Levine moved her 95-year-old mother out of a nursing home under the state's jurisdiction. At the same time, she wanted COVID positive patients to flood nursing homes, because that makes them easier to test or something. RACHEL LEVINE, INCOMING ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF HEALTH: By testing every resident and every staff member in every nursing home, we will be able to pinpoint exactly who has COVID-19, who has been exposed but no symptoms and cohort positive cases to prevent further spread. CARLSON: Tammy Bruce is the host of ""Get Tammy Bruce"" on FOX Nation, we're always happy to have her. Hey, Tammy, thanks for coming on. So this is like the perfect encapsulation of everything I despise about neoliberalism. You're supposed to be thrilled by this person's sexual orientation or sex life or whatever her personal life is, if that's relevant to anything, and not notice that this person is like completely incompetent. And in fact, not just unqualified, but like exactly the wrong person for the job. You're not supposed to like acknowledge that. TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: That's right, and that that's exactly actually the point of identity politics. They want to train you to have that be sufficient, that there has to be no curiosity about what's behind that curtain. And what we can say, of course about incompetence is that it's an equal opportunity offender, that it doesn't matter if you're transgender or not, or a man or a woman, incompetence is incompetence. So she did exactly for the most part, what Andrew Cuomo did here in New York. She had this framework where you could move people and you had to move people into nursing homes, if they were stable. There was no requirement that they not have COVID. And they had about -- I think they've got about 19,000 deaths, half of which came from nursing homes and facilities that had to accept those possibly infected COVID patients. And that's when she moved her own mother out of a facility into a hotel and telling us that clearly, at least for her family, she felt there was a danger and she wanted to remove her mom. So this comes down to really an incompetence based on the issue on which she has been nominated, right, and that is -- it's got to concern every American. Do you remember the time, Tucker, or when we had some nominees withdraw because they had illegal alien nannies? CARLSON: Yes, very well. BRUCE: Right. This is not about a side issue in one's personal life. This was incompetence, causing death and dramatic problems within the sphere of what she has been nominated for. But nobody is supposed to wonder about that. No one is supposed to bring that up and that is a major issue. You know, people maybe won't bring it up because they don't want to be accused of being transphobic. But the real transphobia is nominating this particular transgendered woman, when this country is filled with talent across the board, gays and lesbians, transgendered people, heterosexual people also, and there's plenty, but maybe they don't have the right Democratic credentials, and perhaps too many other questions would be asked. But it's a shame, the transphobia is expecting -- is not expecting much. It's this -- the soft bigotry of low expectations. CARLSON: And I'm supposed to be excited about the clothes this person wears? Like I care. I mean, I actually feel like this is just an effort to see like, how -- you know, how big a middle finger can we wag in the face of the country? We're going to nominate someone who is not only unqualified, but is like so far outside the lines of qualifications. I mean, would you hire someone like that who had done some -- moves your own mother out while putting everyone else in? Would you hire that person for a health related job? I mean, for real? BRUCE: Yes, I mean, this is for Americans. And this is about, you know, from the left, this is the problem they get into, the obsession with checking the boxes. The obsession with effectively the theater of nominations, the theatre of what it is you demonstrate, as opposed to actually delivering on the issues for the American people. And of course, as we know, President Trump had tremendous accomplishments, the Biden administration is going to show us how remarkable President Trump was in that position. CARLSON: Yes, just more symbolic nonsense. Shut up and make my life better. I think that's a fair ask. BRUCE: Yes. CARLSON: Tammy Bruce, great to see you tonight. You do make our lives better. Appreciate you coming on. BRUCE: Thank you, Tucker. CARLSON: So Hillary Clinton has thought a lot about it. She's got some time to do that and she has figured out who was really behind the January 6 insurrection day riot. It's not who you would expect. Maybe it is. We will tell you after the break. CARLSON: It's easy to forget, especially after the past four years, but this country's powerful intelligence agencies weren't always on bad terms with the White House, they usually been used as tools of the White House. That was especially true in the Obama administration. The Obama people didn't have a very hard time getting phone records from say journalists, or FOX News reporters or tens of millions of Americans, all they had to do was call up their friends at the D.O.J. or N.S.A. and boom, your phone is their phone. That's an awful lot of power. Of course, it's an obvious abuse of power and for whatever reason, we're not psychiatrists here, some former members of the Obama administration, long removed from their time in office still fantasize about that power. They think about it a lot. They don't want to see phone records for any reason in particular, they just want to see phone records. Period. They need to see them. So yesterday, the great obsession became too great, too overpowering to hide from the rest of us. Hillary Clinton, the former Secretary of State under Barack Obama admitted in public that she is positively losing her mind without the authority to seize Verizon servers and just take a look around. Just give me one peak, Hillary said, just one peak. ( BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I hope, historically, we will find out who he is beholden to, who pulls his strings. I would love to see his phone records to see whether he was talking to Putin the day that the insurgents invaded our Capitol. CARLSON: I would love to see his phone records. That's not a figure of speech, by the way when Hillary Clinton says it. It's a command. She is convinced the President's phone records will show that he called Vladimir Putin and organized the insurrection at the Capitol Building. There'll be a new impeachment and Hillary Clinton will be named President. But here's the thing, for Hillary Clinton it is not even about power anymore or the presidency or proving the pollsters wrong or any of that. It's about getting access to even more phone records. That's been her real goal all along. Her obsession now laid bare for everyone to see. And unless someone stages a phone record intervention, that's all Hillary Clinton will ever care about, your phone records. Let us see the phone records. You thought they were safe, not from Hillary Clinton. She has a right to them. It's all so crazy, but we're going to enjoy it despite everything. Hope you'll come back tomorrow night, 8:00 p.m., the show that is the sworn enemy of lying pomposity, smugness, and group think. Still no word on when the studio is going to release Insurrection Day starring Bruce Willis. We're waiting and we'll keep you posted when we get that press release. In the meantime, have a great evening, again, despite everything, stay cheerful, it helps. Sean Hannity, next. SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: I am trying. I am trying hard. CARLSON: Me, too. Classification"
2021-02-23,"TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. We take a lot of digs at the media on this show, and we do it for two reasons. It is fun and they deserve it. Recently, we've watched with growing amusement as our media gatekeepers thrash around in a frenzy of foaming hysteria over the possibility that someone somewhere might dare to present facts or form opinions without their expressed written permission. Freelance thinking is what they hate most. It's a threat to their monopoly. They can't say that out loud, so instead, they call it disinformation. Disinformation is the real threat says the guy who thinks his union has the contract on bringing you the news. It's ridiculous. But before you judge these people, take a moment and feel some compassion and consider how they might be feeling right about now. Imagine if you would spend 30 years making a good living as a car mechanic and all of a sudden, GM invents an engine that anyone can fix at home with a screwdriver. You'd be upset. That's how CNN feels about the internet. It is exposing their scam. Naturally, they're a little irrational about it. BRIAN STELTER, CNN CHIEF MEDIA CORRESPONDENT: Millions of Americans clinging to conspiracy theories. This is all evidence of radicalization. And that's not easy to say, it's not an easy word to use. But it's way past time to talk about this honestly. No one should tiptoe past this predicament. Disinformation networks like QAnon are causing people to lose touch with reality. CARLSON: Disinformation networks. That doesn't sound like a misleading social media post. It sounds like a terror cell. And it sounds that way on purpose. The thing about disinformation, they're telling us is that it's not simply harmful to you personally, it's not like eating a pint of Ben & Jerry's or sneaking a smoke while the kids are at school. No. Disinformation isn't a sin, it's a crime. Disinformation hurts everyone. It's an offense against this country. Disinformation is an attack on America and not just on America, but more critically on something called our norms. CHRIS CUOMO, CNN ANCHOR: Our norms are so out of whack that it has become surprising when good things happen. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Even after four years of us talking, you know, night after night about the norms that are being shattered. FAREED ZAKARIA, CNN HOST: He is doing everything to shred every one of these norms. JOHN AVLON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: We can't allow these kind of democratic norms to be shattered. DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR: So we have abided by these norms, but this President is just rogue -- and this administration just blown right through those norms. CUOMO: Not since the Red Scare have once good men and women been dragged into this kind of sabotage of our democracy and social norms. CARLSON: Or norms, shattered, shredded, crushed, destroyed, blown through. Why is it always our norms that are the first to be attacked? Maybe because our norms are democracy's first responders, they run to the sound of gunfire. Norms are like the young lieutenants in Vietnam walking point through the rice paddies, exposing themselves to fire in order to save the platoon. It's a dangerous job being a norm and never more so than now. You thought underwater welding was a treacherous gig? You feared for the guys who fix antennas on skyscrapers? That's nothing. Imagine being a norm in today's America. They don't last long. Okay, we'll stop. It's all pretty amusing and it's hard to resist. Our norms. Our norms. On the other hand, if we're being completely honest here, and we strive to be completely honest, we have to admit there is a kernel of truth in what they're yelling about. There is disinformation out there and it does hurt people, it makes people stupid for one thing, but it also impairs their ability to make wise decisions. You can't know what to do next if you don't know what's really going on. A lot of people in this country are in that position right now. We saw evidence of it just this week, we read a research paper called ""How Informed are Americans about Race and Policing?"" It was published by the Skeptic Research Center. Check it out online if you have a minute. It's a pretty amazing document. The researchers asked people to estimate the number of unarmed African- Americans who were killed by the police in 2019. Here are the results: 44 percent of Americans who described themselves as liberal, believe the total number of killed was, quote ""a thousand or more."" More than a thousand unarmed African-Americans gunned down by cops. Is that true? Well, as it happened, we have definitive statistics on this. They're publicly available. You could find them in about a minute. The actual number of unarmed African-Americans killed by the police in 2019 was 27. So more than a thousand versus the reality of 27, quite a spread, and it was not an anomaly. The rest of the study found similar results. Self-described liberals, for example, believe that a strong majority of people killed by police in 2019 were African-Americans. The actual percentage was less than half that, closer to 25 percent. These are not small mistakes. A lot of Americans are completely and utterly misinformed and that has actual consequences. Public policy can change dramatically on the basis of things people think they know, but don't actually know and we have seen that a lot. Entire police departments got defunded. So it's worth finding out where the public is getting all of this false information, this disinformation, as we'll call it. So we checked. We spent all day trying to locate the famous QAnon, which in the end, we learned is not even a website. If it's out there, we could not find it. Then we checked Marjorie Taylor Greene's Twitter feed because we have heard she traffics in disinformation, CNN told us, but nothing there. Next, we called our many friends in the tight knit Intel community. Could Vladimir Putin be putting this stuff out there? The Proud Boys? Alex Jones? Who is lying to America in ways that are certain to make us hate each other, and certain to destroy our core institutions? Well, none of the above actually. It wasn't Marjorie Taylor Greene. It was cable news. It was politicians talking on TV. They're the ones spreading disinformation to Americans. Maybe they're from QAnon. You be the judge. SEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ): We have a long and wretched and disturbing history in this country of black people being murdered by law enforcement. KAMALA HARRIS (D), VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Training for police officers on implicit racial bias and procedural justice, because to deny it exist is to deny folks liberty and in many cases, life. BETO O' ROURKE (D), FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: How do we continue to lose the lives of unarmed black men in the United States of America at the hands of white police officers? JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I never had to tell my daughter, if she is pulled over, make sure she puts -- for a traffic stop - - put both hands on top of the wheel and don't reach for the glove box because someone may shoot you. CARLSON: So not only are huge numbers of unarmed African-Americans murdered every year because of their race, to deny that or question that fact is to effectively participate in those killings yourself. Denying this is denying them life, as Kamala Harris put it, or as CNN said, it's mass murder. LEMON: No, I'm not telling people to go out there and riot. But tell me what their proportional response to mass murder over the years is? What is a proportional response to that? CARLSON: I'm not telling people to go out and riot, but what is the proportional response to mass murder? Good question CNN. Burning Wendy's, obviously. But were you asking -- this is the missing piece of the puzzle -- are all the victims of this indiscriminate racial violence? Well, in January, MSNBC was pretty sure they had found one. The channel claimed cops had tried to execute an unarmed African-American man called Jacob Blake in Wisconsin and they repeated that claim that Jacob Blake was unarmed, again and again and again. NICOLLE WALLACE, MSNBC HOST: No charges will be brought against the police officer or any of the police officers involved in the shooting of Jacob Blake, who was an unarmed black man who was shot. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Viewers may recall, an officer shot Blake in the back seven times while he was unarmed. PAUL BUTLER, PROFESSOR, GEORGETOWN SCHOOL OF LAW: Another example of African-Americans not receiving equal protection of law. Mr. Blake was unarmed at the time that he was shot. CARLSON: So it's sad that Jacob Blake got shot, sincerely. It's always sad when people get shot, whether you agree with them or not. Period. But why Jacob Blake was shot is kind of the whole point of the story, isn't it? Mr. Blake was unarmed at the time he was shot. That's what they told us again and again. And yet someone in MSNBC's news division forgot to check with Jacob Blake about that. Because a week later, Jacob Blake himself admitted on camera that he was in fact, armed. JACOB BLAKE, SHOT BY POLICE IN KENOSHA, WISCONSIN: I'm rattled, you know, I realized I had dropped my knife, my little pocket knife, so I picked it up after I got off of him because they tazed me and I fell along side with him. I shouldn't have picked it up, only considering what was going on. At that time. I wasn't thinking clearly. CARLSON: Oh, just to be totally clear, we feel sorry for Jacob Blake. He got hurt. It'll change his life forever. But it's not quite the neat little morality tale we thought it was, is it? And again, we're not telling you that, we're not correcting the lie because we're smug and self-satisfied and enjoy highlighting the other people's errors. We are just defending our norms here as any American would. Are we heroes for doing that? We can't say so. It just feels like the right thing to do. But it is a never ending task. We can give you many examples. Here's one from the weekend. Hundreds of activists gathered in New York to stage a march against white nationalism. They said they were seeking justice for an 84-year-old man from Thailand who had been slashed with a box cutter on the subway. A lot of violence in the New York subway right now. Here's one example. Protesters stormed through Washington Square Park chanting slogans like ""Whose streets? Our streets."" One held a sign that read, ""White nationalism is the virus."" Well, maybe it is the virus, but it's hard to know exactly who's been infected with it. Police have now arrested a 19-year-old man called Antoine Watson for the crime. Let's just say it's hard to imagine that Antoine Watson is a white supremacist. So why are they suggesting otherwise? What is all of this about? Well, here's an interesting theory and it comes to us from a researcher called Zach Goldberg, who does not work at CNN by the way. Goldberg looked at every time the term ""racism"" was used in America's largest newspapers, and he noticed a trend. In fact, there was a noticeable spike just after 2011, which not coincidentally, was right around the time of the Occupy Wall Street movement when people were starting to talk about what Wall Street actually does in public. Suddenly, all at once, journalists agreed that the real problem in America is -- it's racism. America is not a place with a screwed up economic system that rewards a tiny number of emotionally damaged grifters, who possess otherwise useless skills applicable only to finance in Pai Gow, a place where everyone else gets poorer, people with real jobs are making less, people in finance are making more. But that's not a problem. Oh, no. Stop talking about it immediately and that's an order. No, America is instead, we learned, a place where the rest of us must hate each other at all times because of our skin colors, which by the way cannot be changed. And that way, once we're all yelling and aggrieved and angry about irresolvable race questions, once we've picked the wound until it won't stop bleeding, we won't have the time to ask even the most basic questions about economics. Questions like: why are all these billionaire hedge fund guys paying half the tax rate I am? And who precisely is getting rich from the Federal Reserve? Where's all that money going? It'd be nice to know, but you don't see a ton of stories about those questions in ""The New York Times."" They're too busy talking about race. It's a pretty sophisticated operation, this cover Wall Street up, if you think about it. Vladimir Putin could never pull it off. He'd buy a few dopey ads on Facebook and call it a day, home to his vodka and bears. No, it takes a sophisticated operator to lie this effectively, to take the central problem of American life, which is the agonizing death of our middle class and cover it with a smokescreen of manufactured race hatred, so that no one even realizes it's happening. You'd really need to be -- well, CNN would put it -- a disinformation network to pull that off. And of course, the irony is because everything is irony is that CNN itself has become a disinformation network, more powerful than QAnon and far more destructive. You've got to wonder if Jeff Zucker is ever going to get hauled up to Congress to ask for that. In the meantime, Jimmy Dore joins us, a man often accused of misinformation, host of ""The Jimmy Dore Show."" He joins us tonight. Jimmy, I appreciate your coming on the show knowing how attacked you are when you do. Why do you think we're hearing so much about misinformation? And I should say you're on the left, I'm not. Both of us have been accused of it. What's this about? JIMMY DORE, HOST, ""THE JIMMY DORE SHOW"": Well, I would just want to say about the -- I think two things can be true. I think your assessment of them not covering the real problem in America is true. I think we can also have a racist criminal justice system just because of the numbers if you look at their own, so we can have two problems at once. Now that, but we -- CARLSON: But don't talk about the other, though. I mean, well, honest and sincere question, why is it for all the conversation we have about race, most of which you're not allowed to participate in actually, no one wants a real conversation about it. But why don't we ever have a conversation about like, what's happening to all this money the Federal Reserve is printing and like, why is it only going to a tiny percentage of the population? Why don't we -- seriously, why don't we have that debate? DORE: Well, that's because -- well, you know, the Democratic Party are beholden just as much as any politician to the Wall Street, the military industrial complex, big healthcare pharma. I mean, liberals believe a lot of things that aren't true. They believe the Russiagate, which was an evidence-free conspiracy theory that they screamed at the top of their lungs for four years. They are still doing it, by the way. And why are we talking about stuff like that instead of the things you want us to talk about and the things I wanted to talk about, which is the economic devastation of America and workers? Why aren't talking about that? That's right. They don't want to talk about that, because both parties are complicit in that, right? I mean, Biden told America that if we voted for Ossoff and Warnock, we're going to get to $2,000.00 checks the next day. That's misinformation because we didn't get it. They told us that we were going to get $2,000.00 checks and now they say $1,400.00 is just the same as $2,000.00 checks. Those are not the same thing. Those are totally different things. That's misinformation right there. And right now, when we -- I can -- you know, when I talk about COVID, I can only do what the Ministry of Information of Truth says is okay to report. So if I said what Andrew Cuomo said two weeks ago that he does not trust the experts when it comes to COVID, I would have my YouTube channel taken down. But the governor who is going to get an Emmy for his COVID handling, by the way, turns out he was completely corrupt, gave immunity to people again because of money who were actually complicit in killing people in nursing homes. And then he covered up the numbers. That was complete misinformation. And this is the guy that the liberal press wants to exalt as some kind of anti- Trump. No, he turned out he was just the biggest mis-informer as anybody and he is still doing it. So, guess what? They are distracting us because they don't want us to see that we live in a failed state, Tucker. This is a failed state. You know, other countries are not doing to their people what we are doing to our people during COVID. Every other country is making sure their workers, if they shut their business down, gets their wages paid. That's happening -- Canada has been getting a $2,000.00 UBI since COVID started plus they already have healthcare. People in the United States do not know that this is the only country handling it this way. We are punishing our own people and nobody can give me an answer. We are fighting over a one-time $2,000.00 check, not a weekly, not a monthly, a one-time $2,000.00 check as if rent only happens once every year instead of it happening monthly. So we are living in a failed state -- Donald Trump got elected, they wanted to talk about Russia and Vladimir Putin instead of the reason why Donald Trump got elected. It was because they abandoned working people, and it turned its back on them in favor of globalism and outsourcing all their jobs. And then, when the economy does tank, they take care of Wall Street and they screw everybody else and that's exactly -- as a matter of policy, that's what they're doing with COVID. When they shut down everybody's business who has a restaurant or a gym or a bar, and they shut them down and they have no relief for those people, they have decided that effectively, as a policy, they are going to kill a third of the economy with no plan to help those people. And you want -- so we had protests all through the summer by black people, and what did they get for it? Nothing. And then we have white people also protesting, what did they get for it? Nothing. They can't even get them a check. But they did impeach a guy who wasn't even President anymore. That was amazing. They could snap their fingers and do an impeachment and we'll still waiting for COVID relief. CARLSON: And they named a Post Office today in the House of Representatives, it is the only vote they took. Amazing. Jimmy Dore, thank you for connecting those dots. I appreciate it. Well, a few weeks ago, we caught Bank of America turning over the private information of its own customers to the F.B.I. without telling them. Now the F.B.I. has been caught spying on Americans, including Members of Congress and nobody is saying anything about this. Senator Josh Hawley is here and he will. Also you may have heard, Tiger Woods rolled over a car today. He was taken to the hospital. What exactly happened? We've got a report on that as well. We'll be right back. CARLSON: We told you a remarkable story last week about the man that Nancy Pelosi has picked to lead a, quote, ""security review"" of the Capitol complex following the January 6th riot there. He is an unbalanced and openly partisan General called Russel Honore. Within days of January 6th, Honore went on television to announce without any evidence whatsoever, that the Capitol Police had somehow been part of a conspiracy and helped the rioters get inside the Capitol Complex on purpose. LT. GEN. RUSSEL HONORE (RET), U.S. ARMY: And they allowed their buddies in yesterday and then destroyed a good portion of our House. So they will -- they had help inside the force and you could assume about 30 percent of that force support the guy in the White House. That's just the demographics. CARLSON: And he went on and on and on and on. If you want to know what this is really about, the response to January 6th, go on the internet and search his name. His greatest hits will let you know this has nothing to do with security or safety. Well, the Senate held its first hearing today to probe what did happen on January 6th, and at that hearing, Senator Josh Hawley asked the former U.S. Capitol Police Chief, Steven Sund to respond what General Honore has said. Watch. SEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R-MO): He has criticized you for -- and I'm quoting now, ""The appearance of complicity during the attack,"" and also said that you potentially undertook complicit actions. Those are his words -- during the attack. Mr. Sund, were you complicit in this attack on January 6th? STEVEN SUND, FORMER U.S. CAPITOL POLICE CHIEF: Absolutely not, sir. I've heard those comments as well. And I think it's disrespectful to myself and to the members of the Capitol Police Department. CARLSON: It is an outrageous thing to say or to suggest, particularly on the basis of zero evidence, but that's not the only norm that's been shredded in the wake of January 6th. We learned today that the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the F.B.I., according to a piece in ""The Intercept,"" seized thousands of phone and electronic records -- texts -- belonging indiscriminately to everyone around the Capitol Complex on January 6th, and that includes Members of Congress, is that legal? How can it be legal? They did it anyway. And the F.B.I. apparently used emergency powers that required no warrant. It's a remarkable story. No one is talking about this. Senator Hawley joins us tonight to respond. Senator, thanks so much for coming on. So first, to your exchange over General Honore today. Do you think this man who was an open partisan and I would say a bigot and a conspiracy person -- could he take the role that Nancy Pelosi has designated for, do you think? HAWLEY: This is absolutely outrageous, Tucker, the idea that he is going to lead a security review. This is a guy who did what we've seen the liberals do time and again. He blamed the police first. He has no facts. He has no idea what actually went on and he is out there blaming the police and saying that they are complicit, that they helped the rioters. It's absolutely outrageous. But if you look at his history, he has over and over again blamed law enforcement. He criticized law enforcement who were responding to rioters all last summer, including in Portland and elsewhere. This is somebody who has no business -- no business -- leading a security review. CARLSON: So the capital city of the United States is still occupied by the U.S. military tonight. No one will make them leave or even demand an explanation for why they're there. Now, we learn that the F.B.I. took with no warrant, stole effectively phone records from Members of Congress and anyone who was at the Capitol that day? How can that be legal? HAWLEY: I'm not sure that it is legal, Tucker. And I have to say, it's unbelievable to read this stuff in the press. This is the only way that members to my knowledge, at least, that Members of Congress are finding out about any of this. And once again, we've got the F.B.I. going and doing this stuff without oversight. Now listen, our law enforcement agencies should be tracking down criminals. They should be bringing them to justice. They should be prosecuting them to the fullest extent of the law. The issue here is and we've seen this movie before, we've seen these law enforcement agencies go way over and above and sweep in law abiding activity. We've seen the corporations get in on this act. You reported about Bank of America voluntarily apparently turning over customer's personal data. Now, we've got the telecoms apparently turning over, it is reported, the messages, cell phone data of folks who we have no reason to believe were anything other than law-abiding. I mean, this is really, really frightening stuff. And to those who say we need a new domestic war on terror that will give even more unaccountable power to these law enforcement agencies without any kind of oversight, that is a scary prospect, and I'm totally opposed to it. There needs to be real oversight here and real accountability. CARLSON: I mean, if the Democratic Party is trying to create violent extremism, they're doing exactly what you would do if you wanted to create them. They are making people paranoid and crazy. People feel totally undefended and afraid. Will more Republicans stand up and say, wait a second, we want to -- you know, what are the troops doing here? Why is the F.B.I. stealing our text messages? Will anybody push back other than you, do you think? HAWLEY: Well, I sure hope so. And you know, you heard today at this hearing, I mean, you heard at least one other member, Senator Rick Scott ask, what about all of these National Guard troops? Thousands of them here, why are they here? Nobody had any answers for him. Nobody could answer him. We still can't get any answers as Members of Congress. So this is -- there has got to be real accountability. There's got to be real oversight. CARLSON: Yes, it's starting to really scare people. It really is, I think. Senator, I appreciate you coming on tonight. HAWLEY: Thank you. CARLSON: Thanks. So George Floyd died last summer, and we began a revolution to dismantle the systems of oppression. We've noticed that many of those systems remain totally un-dismantled, unchanged. The real power centers in our country are thriving, places like Yale and Harvard. Why is that? We have a plan to fix it actually, after the break. CARLSON: So sometimes, it's hard to see the outlines because we're right in the middle of it. But America really is in the middle of a profound social upheaval. Nothing is the same as it was a year ago. That's not your imagination, it is really happening. What we're seeing is an actual history changing revolution in place of Robespierre's famous liberty, equality, fraternity, our H.R. Departments have produced their own three word revolutionary slogan: diversity, equity inclusion. Now, this is different from what has happened in other countries. Unlike the revolutions in most places, in America, the working class is not the hero of this story. Our working class is the villain. This is not a proletarian revolution. It's a revolution from above. It's aimed straight downward and you can tell by who is running it. College professors write the radical literature, politicians put their words into practice, the biggest companies in the world pay for all of it. So maybe not surprisingly, for all their revolutionary fervor, the groups pushing this revolution leave their own power untouched. When you hear people talking about dismantling systems of oppression, they're not talking about themselves, they are talking about you. This is a revolution expressly designed to empower the already powerful and it's been that way since the first day since the summer when George Floyd died in Minneapolis. Now the first and most obvious question we might have asked at the time and no one ever asked this, but it is clear, why was a 46-year-old man reduced to passing badly counterfeited $20.00 bills in a convenience store in the middle of the day? George Floyd was unemployed. Why was he unemployed? How many other people like George Floyd are unemployed and why? Now, that would have been an interesting conversation. It might have been a fruitful conversation for all of us, but we didn't have it and we did not have it by design. Instead, we learned a lot about the racial composition of the Minneapolis Police Department. We were told the police there weren't quote, ""diverse enough"" and that was a national emergency. Months later, BLM mobs destroyed the City of Kenosha, Wisconsin, and once again, we were informed that the main problem was a lack of diversity among Kenosha's low-paid cops. Quote, ""Overall,"" the local Kenosha newspaper announced with what sounded like genuine alarm, "" ... the city's police force is 89 percent white, while the city's population is about 67 percent white."" Okay, Kenosha, too many white hourly workers makes your city burn. That is the message. And as a result of that message, everything changed. But actually, not everything changed. In fact, many things stayed precisely the same. The patterns of residential segregation, for example, they did not change. They accelerated. Barack Obama's neighborhoods in Washington, Hawaii, and Martha's Vineyard are probably less quote, ""diverse"" than they were a year ago, and that won't change soon because of too many people who have a lot of money live there. But most striking of all, now that we are discussing things that have not changed at all, have been the universities. The overwhelming majority of ideas behind this revolution come from college campuses. Everything you hear about white privilege and systemic racism began as a lecture about deconstruction in some classroom in 1990s, and that is why so many BLM activist talk like sociology professors. But most of the actual changes on college campuses have been superficial. Yes, the coursework is very different. Yale no longer even pretends to teach its students anything, it just indoctrinates them. But here is what has not changed at all, and this is the key to everything. What hasn't changed at all is the kind of people who go to Yale in the first place. They are rich kids from rich families who plan on staying rich. Not speculation. Here are the numbers. Before COVID, the median family income in the United States was about 65 grand a year. At Yale, it's three times that. The median family income of a Yale University student is $192,000.00 a year. That is the median. At the University of Pennsylvania, it is about $196,000.00 a year. At Brown University in Providence, it is $204,000.00. These are all Ivy League schools with multibillion-dollar endowments, endowments heavily subsidized by you through your tax dollars. So they can afford to educate poor kids, they just choose not to. At Princeton, 72 percent of students come from families in the top 20 percent nationally for household income. Nobody seems to have any plans to change any of this. Diversity is for wage earners, not for the people in charge. No one is trying to diversify prestigious campuses because in real life, let's be honest, the lack of diversity is the real reason that people go there in the first place. No one applies to Yale in order to learn things. That is not the point. The point of going to Yale is to cement your position as a credentialed member of America's ruling class. That's the singular purpose of the experience, the only purpose. More than any other standard, more than any award in American society, an Ivy League degree increases the chance that those who hold it, in the end, will be giving the orders, not taking the orders. That effect is real and it lasts for generations. When you go to Yale, your grandkids probably won't have to work construction. So the question is: why should this arrangement continue? And that is a serious question, especially now. If you are going to dismantle systemic power, and we have decided we are going to, you probably should not start with unionized cops in Kenosha. You probably should start with systems that wield actual power. America really does have a class system. They are absolutely right about that. That system is getting more rigid by the day and we should probably do something about it pretty soon, or the next revolution might not be as peaceful as this one. So here's an idea: beginning immediately, the top ranked 50 colleges and universities in America should be prohibited, by force of law if necessary, from accepting students whose parents or grandparents went to college. No more rich kids. Harvard should be reserved exclusively for students who have never experienced the many advantages of living in a ruling class. If you are for diversity, equity, and inclusion, there is no faster way to achieve it than this. So what would happen to Harvard if we did this? It wouldn't be hard for Harvard or any top school to find new students. Millions of college aged kids are itching for the opportunity, and we know they are. For example, the Biden administration just announced plans to give amnesty and citizenship to an estimated 30 million foreign nationals now living in the United States illegally. Now, as of right now, you should know this, there is no plan to elevate any of these new Americans into our middle class. No. The plan is to keep them in serfdom at the bottom of the economic ladder. Somebody needs to trim our trees and toss our kale salads -- that is the view of Democratic donors and they get their way always. But why should the rest of us accept their plan? Designed only to benefit them, it is so obviously unfair. Why shouldn't the children of impoverished illegal aliens go to Duke? Cornell? Stanford? Williams? Amherst? Princeton? Why shouldn't they occupy every single bed on every single one of those campuses? But wait a second, you ask, says the Democratic donor, if the Honduran immigrants get into Columbia, who's going to work at the chicken plants? Oh, good question. We nominate the children of ""New York Times"" editors. Now, ""New York Times"" editors might not like this arrangement very much. They may incite revolution at work. But at the same time, they are fanatically intent on sending their own kids to Yale, and they will do absolutely anything to get them into Yale. They definitely don't want their kids working at chicken plants. They want them working at McKinsey. But the problem is, in a revolutionary moment like this, you can't always get what you want. Especially when you're as committed to diversity, equity and inclusion as your average ""New York Times"" editor claims to be. In order to make omelets in this world, you've got to break some eggs. So here's our advice to the members of the woke professional class at ""The Times"" and elsewhere, who are about to discover that their own rules might actually apply to themselves. Here's our advice: stop complaining. When you discover that your own children's life plans have been thwarted due to some new imperative from social justice, don't say a word. Don't whine or moan or file a lawsuit. Don't even acknowledge it is happening. Just accept it. It's not like you can pretend you didn't know the meritocracy was fake. You singlehandedly destroyed it yourselves. For years, you thought you had an exemption to the rules that you made. You imagined that challenging power applied only to other people's families. Sorry, the revolution has finally come for you. You pictured your kids graduating from the local friend school and moving on to Cornell to immerse themselves in Gender Studies and International Relations. Whoa, but not anymore. It's a new era. Again, an era that you designed. Now your kids will be taking the bus to a poultry processing facility in rural Iowa to begin their new lives serving the critical culinary needs of the people they replace, the ones now going to Cornell. And maybe someday, if they're lucky, your kids can learn to code. But no matter what happens to them over the next several generations, don't fret. And once again, above all, don't complain. Complaining is racist. Diversity is our strength. We're a nation of immigrants. That's the main idea of America, which, as you have often told us is simply an idea, not a nation. Now all of this might be hard for you to see right now. It's painful and we get it because it's happening to you. It might even seem unjust. Trust us, it is not unjust. It's the definition of justice. Well, operating a small business is now illegal in many places in California, but one restaurant owner has decided -- I am not going to put up with it anymore. We're going to talk to that owner about what he is planning, straight ahead. CARLSON: As you've probably seen, golfer Tiger Woods was involved in a pretty bad car accident today. We're going to have an update on his condition and more information about what exactly happened. FOX's Matt Finn has that story for us tonight. Hey, Matt. MATT FINN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Tucker. Officials confirmed this is the hospital that Tiger Woods was taken to in serious condition earlier today after that horrifying rollover accident. And this evening, the LA County Sheriff says that the luxury Genesis SUV that Tiger Woods was driving rolled several hundred feet after it hit a median in Rancho Palos Verdes. The gold legend's agent tweeted that Woods suffered multiple leg injuries and was sent into surgery. The Sheriff says the area that Woods was driving in has slopes and curves and has a high frequency of accidents and that Woods' SUV was driving at a relatively greater speed than normal. Tonight, the Sheriff says Tiger Woods is lucky to be alive. He was wearing his seatbelt and did not show signs of impairment. Woods was conscious and able to talk. He was extricated from that SUV using a prying tool and an axe. Right now, it's not clear exactly what condition Tiger Woods is in at this hospital, but his injuries have been described as non-life threatening. We'll keep you updated -- Tucker. CARLSON: Matt Finn, appreciate that. Well, large swathes of our largest state, California, remain locked down tonight. State and local officials haven't offered any reason for it. If you ask them directly, they'll blame other states. For example, watch the Chairman of San Diego County's Board of Supervisors, a man called Nathan Fletcher explain that he is not really responsible for managing his own county. QUESTION: There are 45 states that do not have school closure orders. San Francisco and Chicago are now reopening their schools. Long Island, New York just started to let their high school athletes play sports and it's going great. Cities all across the country are reopening businesses. Our case rates here in San Diego and ICU numbers are as good, if not better than theirs. Why is their science different than San Diego County? And why are we so behind? NATHAN FLETCHER, CHAIRMAN OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY' S BOARD OF SUPERVISORS: You would have to ask them, Tommy. CARLSON: Yes, just ask -- you know, ask Idaho. Well, hundreds of businesses in California have now decided they've had enough of this insanity. Michael Curran is a lawyer. He represents about 600 of them. A few days ago, he made it clear that those businesses plan to stay open. MICHAEL CURRAN, ATTORNEY: We have determined that, you know, we are the people and when the government doesn't get it, right, we gave them the power to govern, we can take it back. Today, we take it back. We are declaring ourselves open for business outdoor, indoor safely and responsibly. These are adults and very good business owners. They're very good restauranteurs. They know how to run their businesses. They've done it safely for generations. We don't need a governor to tell us how to or not to run these businesses. They know how. CARLSON: Finally, someone before Amazon runs your local pizzeria. Fabio Montagna is the owner of Maurizio's Trattoria Italiana Restaurant. Michael Curran is his lawyer, he represents him and as we, said many others. Fabio and Michael join us tonight. We appreciate your coming on. Thank you, both. So just to be totally clear, Fabio, first to you about what your plan is. You run a restaurant, they told you apparently you have to shut it. But you're not, is that correct? FABIO MONTAGNA, OWNER, MAURIZIO' S TRATTORIA ITALIANA RESTAURANT: Good evening, Mr. Tucker. Thank you so much for having me here. Basically, thanks to my lawyer, Michael Curran, part of our constitutional rights, we are following all the protocol, all the health system. Unfortunately, I cannot close my business anymore. It's me and my employees. It's been like over 11 months, right now we're dealing with this big virus going on. Unfortunately, after so many months, to me, I have a wife and daughter to take care. This is something. We are a small business, try to make our living day by day with me, all my employees who have been through this crazy year, let's say, which was completely hard for us. As a business owner, to make, like we came out the fine dining and try to work with the community with a sign and follow all the protocol. We invest a lot of money on the outside, you know, try to do improve after improve. And believe me, after one year, we struggle. We don't know how to go anymore. We open up the indoor and then they ask us to invest the money on the outdoor, that's what we did. You know what I mean? Bigger space, new plants, new awning. We invest all we have. And right now, in December, they come up and they told like guys, you have to close again. Believe me, if I close my business again, means, I will close for good. I won't see my beautiful wife, my daughter, and all my employees, which we're working together as a family place for over 12 years. And you know, this is something like over everything we're talking about life. Yes. CARLSON: Well, I understand that completely. And we've seen a lot of it. And I want to ask you, Michael Curran, who is leading this effort on behalf of so many small businesses. On the East Coast, people who stand up and say, I'm sorry, I can't do this anymore have been crushed by the state. Are you worried that will happen to these businesses? CURRAN: Well, you know, we were in the very beginning. We started this as a constitutional peaceful protest. We told these business owners, they can exercise their constitutional rights. You know, just because we have a pandemic, the United States in California Constitution, they don't go away. They are still in full force in effect. CARLSON: That's right. CURRAN: We have let this Governor know. We have let local politicians know that you may choose to ignore the Constitution and the liberties and the rights that it affords us. We're not going to ignore those, we're going to exercise our constitutional rights to stay open. And for us, that takes the form of keeping our businesses open safely and responsibly. CARLSON: Amen. I can't overstate how much we're rooting for you, not just on the show, but I think a lot of people around the country are hoping that someone can finally stand up and put an end to this. So thank you both for coming on tonight. MONTAGNA: Thank you. CURRAN: Tucker, we appreciate your support of our constitutional fight, thank you. CARLSON: Oh, man, you have it. Thank you, guys. We have a lot more we come back. We'll be right back. CARLSON: We told you the other night that this show was going to be expanding on to FOX Nation in just over a month. We'll be bringing you a viral -- a video podcast -- I hope it's viral -- several times a week. Also launching a new deeper series called ""Tucker Carlson Originals."" We've gotten a lot of e-mails from people saying they're not exactly sure how to get all of this, how to sign up for FOX Nation. Obviously, we promised we'll explain all of that before this launches. But we'll back every week night on this show, the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink, and a friend of Sean Hannity's who joins us right now from New York. Classification"
2021-01-18,"TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. Our capital city, Washington is under military occupation tonight. By Inauguration Day, there are expected to be more than 26,000 armed Federal troops in Washington. No living American has seen a moment like the one we're watching now; 26,000 soldiers, that's more than five times the number of American military personnel currently stationed in Iraq and Afghanistan combined. That is more than twice the number of troops that President Lyndon Johnson ordered to Washington in April of 1968. In April of 1968, Washington, D.C. was literally on fire. Race riots had broken out after the assassination of Martin Luther King, whose memory we celebrate today. More than a thousand people were injured in those riots and at least 13 of them died. Much of the capital was leveled, and it stayed that way. Blocks of charred rubble for decades. If you visited Washington in the 1990s, you'll remember what it looked like. But according to our current leaders, the so-called insurrection of January 6th was much worse than any of that. So far, here's the death toll from that day. A police officer was hit in the head by rioters then later had a stroke and died at a local hospital. An unarmed protester was shot to death by authorities as she tried to climb through a window, a woman may have been trampled to death by the crowd. As of tonight, those are the three casualties we can confirm from the riot at the Capitol Building on January 6th. In response to that, our leaders have assembled the largest military presence in Washington in all of American history during peacetime. In 1864, as the Civil War raged on the other side of the Potomac and Americans died every day in large numbers in battle, there were fewer Federal troops protecting Washington, D.C. than there are tonight. And it's truly a national force. The Guardsmen you see in Washington have come from every state in the Union, as well as from Puerto Rico. And the question is, why is that? There's no practical or operational justification for it. For decades, Washington, D.C. has the highest per capita law enforcement presence in the country and one of the highest in the world. So there was no need to fly in troops from Alaska to keep the city safe. But keeping the city safe was hardly the point of the exercise. The murder rate in the District of Columbia has risen with terrifying speed over the last six months: men, women and children shot to death in the streets. But no one in charge seems to care about that or even notice their deaths. So no matter what they are telling you, those 26,000 Federal troops are not there for your safety. Instead, unmistakably, the Democratic Party is using those troops to send the rest of us a message about power: ""We're in charge now."" We run this nation from Honolulu to our colony in the Caribbean, and everything in between very much, including where you and your family live. Do not question us. Men with guns enforce our decrees, we control the Pentagon. And indeed, they do control The Pentagon. Republicans have spent years ignoring the leftward drift of our officer corps, but we can't ignore it now. The mask is off. Our military leadership, the very same generals who howled at the idea of deploying American troops to stop an invasion of our southern border, those same generals sent tens of thousands of soldiers with rifles to Washington purely as a show of force on behalf of the political party they support. And once they did that, they then allowed Democratic politicians to degrade and politicize the military itself. Democrats in Congress demanded that the troops sent to Washington this week, submit to a political purity test, ideological vetting, as they put it, to make certain that every soldier professed loyalty to the new regime. Not loyalty to our country, not loyalty to our Constitution, but loyalty to the aims of a specific political party. Nothing like that has ever happened in America. And just a few months ago, it would have been unimaginable. Suddenly, it's compulsory. Here's Congressman Steve Cohen of Memphis, explaining why it is. REP. STEVE COHEN (D-TN): The Guard is 90 some odd percent, I believe, male. Only about 20 percent of white males voted for Biden. You've got to figure that in the Guard, which is predominately more conservative and I see that on my social media, we know it. There are probably not more than 25 percent of the people that are there protecting us who voted for Biden, the other 75 percent are in the class that would be the large class of folks who might want to do something. CARLSON: We should pause that tape and we should consider for a moment and think deeply about what Congressman Steve Cohen of Tennessee just told us on television. He said that every white man in this country is a potential murderer. Every white man in America should be under suspicion purely on the basis of being white and male of planning a presidential assassination. He told us the National Guard is overwhelmingly white and male. Therefore, Congressman Cohen says, white male National Guardsmen must undergo government background checks to prove they are not planning murder. Steve Cohen didn't couch any of that. He just said it, and the CNN anchor nodded as he did. The rules on generalizations like this have changed quite a bit in a very short time. It wasn't that long ago, it was November 5, 2009, that an Army major called Nidal Hasan opened fire on innocent people at a military base in Texas. Nidal Hasan shot 45 people at Fort Hood, 13 of them died. When it emerged later that Hasan was an Islamic extremist, and then it emerged that the Army had failed to notice his extremism or in any way protect the public from his extremism. No one at The Pentagon was Court Martialed. Instead, the rest of us sat through months of lectures about how we had no right to come to broader conclusions about what had happened at Fort Hood. Yes, the shootings were bad, though not Barack Obama made clear at the time an act of terrorism. But far worse than mass murder, we were told would be the sin of drawing any connection between the Nidal Hasan's beliefs and the beliefs of anyone else in our country. Nidal Hasan was a single person, literally a lone gunman. He was not a stand in for all Muslims. So stop with your prejudice, rednecks. That's what they told us. And by the way, it is okay that they told us that. Most Americans are decent people, they don't blame entire groups for the crimes of a few. Bigotry is immoral, and so is collective punishment. There is nothing more un-American than that, but not anymore. Collective punishment is now the official policy of the Federal government and it is enforced by The Pentagon. You'd love at some point to ask Congressman Cohen about the implications of this. Since we've established this new standard, this new requirement of collective punishment, what other groups of Americans, Congressman Cohen should be denounced and hurt simply because of the way they look? Simply because of the DNA they were born with? Or does this new standard apply only to white men? And if it does apply exclusively to white men, which is definitely the impression we're getting from you, how does targeting white men contribute to your stated goal of reducing white male extremism? Because doesn't attacking people on the basis of qualities they can't control make them more extreme, not less extreme? Aren't you persecuting them into behaving in precisely the ways you claim you don't want them to behave? And since you're not a moron, wouldn't all of that be obvious to you? So why are you doing it? Why in the name of fighting extremism, are you Congressman Cohen creating extremism? By the way dead certain, no question about it. That's exactly what you're doing. What, Steve Cohen, is your motive for doing that? That's a sincere question by the way? Congressman Cohen is invited on this show anytime to give us his answer. In the meantime, you've got to wonder about what the Guardsmen themselves think of all of this -- this new policy? Serving in the National Guard is not easy work. Guardsmen aren't paid much. Some you've got to imagine are doing it for love of country. Now, they've been deployed to their country's own capital city, and they've been given orders to shoot their fellow Americans if necessary. That's a lot to ask. Now, suddenly, on top of all of that, they've been told that if they were born a certain way, if they are white and male, and therefore evil and dangerous, they themselves are under suspicion of being the enemy, they are potential killers, assassins, betrayers of a nation. We're not overstating this for effect. Here's a National Guard Commander in Puerto Rico describing to his troops the enemy they will face in Washington. They are white nationalists, he tells them, they are Proud Boys. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Speaking in foreign language.) CARLSON: If you wanted to stoke in irreparable civil conflict, you would talk this way and you would keep talking that way. You tell armed men under your command that they might have to shoot people who voted for the wrong candidate in the last election. You can see where this could all go. It's really scary. So where's the pushback from our defenders? Well, we didn't get any calls today from Republican senators begging to come on this show to talk about any of this or to push back against it. The Democratic Party is using the military of the United States, which they do not own as a political weapon. But Republicans in Congress just can't be bothered to notice that. You think officers of The Pentagon would be outraged by this. It's such a total betrayal of everything our country and the military are supposed to stand for. Yet, as far as we know tonight, not a single officer has resigned in protest. Background checks on people because of their race and sex? Because of their political views? Why aren't they protesting? Why aren't they resigning? We can't say. We know some clearly agree with all of this and they'd like to see it accelerate, quote, ""I was chief prosecutor of Guantanamo for over two years,"" a former Air Force Colonel called Moe Davis announced on Twitter today, "" ... and there's far more evidence of Congressman Madison Cawthorn's guilt than the guilt of more than 95 percent of the detainees. It is time we start a domestic war on sedition by American terrorists."" That's a verbatim quote. And we'll repeat that sentence in case you thought you heard it incorrectly or we're making it up, we are not. A career American military officer has now called for, quote, ""A domestic war on sedition by American terrorists,"" a war. Among those terrorists, the ones he says are literally more dangerous than al Qaeda and therefore must be imprisoned and killed is a 25-year-old wheelchair bound Madison Cawthorn, who was just elected by American voters to the United States Congress. But according to Colonel Moe Davis, Congressman Cawthorn and the millions of Americans who agree with him, the ones who voted Republican in November must be subdued by force. They are the enemy our military exists to fight. Now keep in mind that Colonel Davis -- Colonel Moe Davis, spent his life under arms, so you can be certain he isn't using the term enemy in some metaphorical sense as in Oreos are the enemy of an effective diet. No. He means enemy in the way Osama bin Laden and his coconspirators at Gitmo were our enemies, and you remember what we did to Osama bin Laden. Has Twitter seen Moe Davis's tweet? Has the Secret Service? Do they care? Does anyone? Well, you know the answer. Will a single one of Colonel Moe Davis's many allies in the Democratic Party denounce what he said, or even tell him to cool it a little bit? And what about the news media? Reporters are perpetually on the hunt for what they describe as dangerous extremism. Have they noticed Colonel Moe Davis on Twitter? Probably they have, but of course they agree with them. Just today, ""The Daily Beast,"" the homepage of our highly credentialed, but not super bright ruling class ran a piece with this title: ""Can U.S. Spy Agency Stop White Terror?"" ""Other countries,"" the story pointed out, "" ... have domestic spy agencies to fight extremists at home."" So of course we need one right away. What the piece does not mention that those other countries would include China, North Korea and Kazakhstan. Domestic spy agency is a not very subtle euphemism for secret police. That is what they're calling for. Now you'd think talk like that would constitute a big red line for the many professional freedom defenders in Washington, the ones you send money to, the think tank libertarians for example. They're everywhere. But not tonight. Where are they tonight? A former U.S. military officer declares war on American citizens. Members of the media call for a secret police agency. This is the stuff of libertarian nightmares. It's what they claim to hate. So where are they now? Why isn't billionaire libertarian man of principle Charles Koch spending billions of dollars to stop this -- these abridgement of liberty, these unprecedented attacks on liberty? He is definitely not spending billions to stop it. He doesn't seem doing anything. No one is. And so it continues unabated. Democrats in Congress support a new secret police agency, but why wouldn't they support it? What better way to protect your own power than funding a quote, ""domestic spy agency"" to fight extremists at home? Those extremists needless to say, will be their political opponents, so you don't have to worry about them anymore because they'll be in jail. Just last year, Congressman Brad Schneider of Illinois sponsored legislation to begin the process of creating just such an agency, empowering current agencies to spy on Americans based on their political beliefs. And guess what? Schneider's bill sailed out of the House Judiciary Committee, all but two Republicans voted for it. Nor did Republicans say a word when Congresswoman Grace Meng of New York sponsored a bill to criminalize the quote, ""purchase, ownership or possession of body armor."" Body Armor? Not the ownership of guns or bombs or even knives. That's where you thought we were. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas just introduced legislation to require a license from the government in order to own ammunition. Well, that seems nonsensical and extreme, especially from a party that released thousands of violent criminals from prison in just the last year. But no, it's much crazier than that, it's banning body armor. Devices that cannot under any circumstances be used to hurt another person. Body armor is purely defensive. Body armor exists only to protect the person who is wearing the body armor. It is already a crime to use body armor in most places while committing a violent felony. This is different. This would make it a crime to possess body armor at all. Why don't you do that? Why don't you make it a crime to possess something designed to save your life? That'd be like banning seatbelts or banning helmets. And actually now that we mentioned it, Grace Meng's bill would ban helmets, any helmet that might protect you from gunfire -- for real. And honestly, you should pause when you hear that. What could possibly be the motive for it? We can't think of a non-sinister explanation for banning body armor. It should make you nervous to hear it's even being considered. But again Republicans never said a word about this. They were too busy agreeing with Democrats that what happened at the Capitol was a white supremacist insurrection. Senator Jim Lankford of Oklahoma who tells his voters he is conservative just apologized to African-American voters for ever mentioning the possibility of voter fraud, since somehow that is now racist. How is that racist exactly? We'll tell you exactly the truth. What happened on January 6 was awful. We don't like mobs. We don't like vandalism. We don't like violence. We said it at the time. We'll say it again now, we'll never stop saying it. But what happened on January 6 was not an insurrection and there was nothing racial about it. That is a total lie. It is told and repeated purely for political advantage. Here is what it actually looked like inside the Capitol when the first demonstrators burst in. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey. Hey, man. Glad to see you guys. You guys are [bleep] patriots. Look at this guy. He has got -- he is covered in blood. God bless you. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You good, sir? Do you need medical attention? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm good. Thank you. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All right. I got shot in the face. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Where are they? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I got shot in the face with some kind of plastic bullet. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Any chance I could get you guys to leave the Senate wing? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We will. I've been making sure they ain't disrespecting the place. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Okay, I just want to let you guys know this is like the sacredest place. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I know. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I know. CARLSON: Just chatting with the cop on the House floor. The guy in the Viking hat, Chewbacca man, you've seen him before is a real life person. His name is Jacob Chansley. Chansley is sitting in jail tonight. He's being held without bail. Bail was denied on Friday. The judge who ordered him to rot in jail presented no evidence that Chansley was violent or a threat to anyone. Nevertheless, the judge concluded quote, ""This is an insurrection"" and Jacob Chansley was, quote, ""a symbol of what occurred."" He now faces 25 years or more in prison if convicted. You just saw the crime. The real crime though, was being a symbol of insurrection. No matter what happens, Jacob Chansley will almost certainly do more time in prison than countless murderers, rapists and armed robbers. Actual criminals aren't a problem for the Democratic Party. In fact, they're an important constituency and it shows. Since Memorial Day, about 90 percent of the people arrested for gun crime in New York City, for example, have been released back onto the streets free to do it again. Gun crime? Really? From the party that is against gun crime, right? Gun crime, gun violence. Yes, 90 percent released. Because unlike Jacob Chansley, they are not symbols of insurrection. Anyone else who is not a symbol of insurrection? These people. CARLSON: That was your country for months and months on end. Now, they are pretending none of that ever happened, but it did happen. Mobs of politicized thugs, virtually every one of whom supported the violent overthrow of the elected President and said so loudly at every opportunity and spray painted on buildings, went on to torch and loot and vandalized major American cities. In the City of Minneapolis, Minnesota alone, BLM and Antifa rioters burned or destroyed more than 700 buildings. How many innocent people did they kill? We've counted more than two dozen nationwide, not including the many hundreds murdered by criminals who are sprung from lockup in the name of George Floyd. We don't know the full death toll. We probably will never know. Nobody is keeping track. There's no political advantage in tallying the people that your side kills. But it's not a problem, they tell us, because none of that was an insurrection, not even symbolically. So how long will this cycle go on? If you're hoping America will revert to normal on Wednesday afternoon after Joe Biden is sworn in as President, you are an optimist. You probably assume the quarantines and mandatory face coverings were temporary, too. Probably not. Something awful has been unleashed on our country; unchecked, it will inevitably lead to more awful things. Every action provokes a reaction -- that is Physics, it is also human nature. Abraham Lincoln understood this well. In January of 1838, Lincoln spoke to an audience in Springfield, Illinois about what happens when a society refuses to punish thugs and vandals. It's not a small thing. ""Citizens,"" Lincoln said, "" ... see their property destroyed, their families insulted and their lives endangered; their persons injured; and seeing nothing in prospect that forebodes a change for the better, they become tired of and disgusted with a government that offers them no protection."" At that point, Lincoln noted, they become radical. They do things they never would have considered if the authorities had bothered to enforce the laws they made in the first place. In other words, they become liable to show up at the Capitol Building in Viking hats and face paint. You could have scripted what was going to happen on January 6. What we can't know is what happens next. And let's pray that the people planning a war on American citizens find their reason and their decency and stop talking like that immediately, much less planning to act on it. Let's hope the Biden Campaign didn't really mean it when they promised to make, quote, ""The same commitment to root out domestic terrorism as we have to stopping international terrorism."" Think about that. How would that project end? You know. The truth is, we don't deserve that. Very few Americans deserve to be treated like Osama bin Laden, because they're not terrorists. They shouldn't be treated like ISIS. Most Americans are good people, even if you hate how they voted. We don't need a war within our borders. Stop calling for one, people in charge. Only the worst people will win that war. Huey Long understood this. Huey Long was maybe the only true economic populist ever elected to the United States Senate. He was a Democrat back at a time when you could be an economic populist and still a Democrat. And for that, he was more hated than Donald Trump ever imagined he could be hated by everyone, not just Republicans, but by the sitting Democratic President Franklin Roosevelt. Huey Long was a very flawed guy, they always are but he wasn't stupid. In fact, he had flashes of wisdom. In 1935, Huey Long had a flash of wisdom. Here's what he said: ""If the United States ever winds up with a fascist government, quote, ""We will have it under the guise of antifascism."" That's right. Jason Whitlock is standing by to react to everything that's happening in the world and we're glad he is. Also, why teachers at your kids' school may need to undergo antiracist therapy. Joe Biden has just taken a major step toward making that happen. It's on the way, next. CARLSON: As we told you a moment ago, Washington, D.C. is tonight, and it's not an exaggeration under military occupation, 26,000 troops expected by Wednesday morning. That's more Federal troops that protected Washington in 1864 during the Civil War. And to put even a finer point on what's actually happening, the Secret Service has established what is calling a green zone. Remember that term? We rolled in to Baghdad in March of 2003. We expelled Saddam and we took his palace, his White House, if you will, and made it green zone out of it. What exactly is going on here? Jason Whitlock is a longtime journalist and a wise person and we've asked him to assess what he thinks is happening. Jason, thanks a lot for coming on. What do you think this is? JASON WHITLOCK, OUTKICK.COM: Tucker, I have to start here. Your opening monologue is the most powerful, profound, poignant thing I've seen on television in 20 years. I hope that every American citizen, conservative, liberal, Republican, Democrat, black, white, gay, straight, they need to hear that. It needs to be debated and talked about. What's going on in America, we are in a scary time. American freedoms are being obliterated under the name of politics, under the name -- under the guise of installing equality, and they're stripping us of our American freedoms. I'm so moved by what you said. I'm so thankful I was here to witness it. I hope that I can amplify that message in some way because we have a problem here in America. The elites are running over the working class. We are demonizing a class of people, 75 million Americans, if not more, we are destroying them. I'm looking at the media, the voiceless are being trampled upon. Nancy Pelosi and all these politicians, Republican or Democrat, are acting as if they just went through Pearl Harbor and they did not. It was on tape. We've seen what happened. Was it the right thing? No. But it was not Pearl Harbor, and we have kids in America, living with gun violence, helicopters overhead, gang violence, gang culture, who are being traumatized every day, and I'm supposed to feel sorry for Nancy Pelosi because people walked into the Capitol? I didn't -- I'm so glad you've taken this on and what you said was so powerful and I just hope people will hear you on it and discuss it, debate it, disagree with, but just hear it. CARLSON: And people are saying some very, very radical things and what worries me is that once people start saying these things, other people respond with radical things, and I really feel like the people with the most power are pushing us toward a place where something awful is absolutely inevitable. I don't understand how we get out of this before something terrible happens, and probably, a lot of people to blame for that. But the people with the most power, officeholders in the Congress right now, Congressman Steve Cohen of Tennessee comes to mind immediately are implicated in that. If Donald Trump is responsible for urging people toward the Capitol, and I think it's fair to say he does bear some responsibility for that, then how culpable will Steve Cohen and the rest be for the next awful, maybe really awful thing that happens? After they spent every day on television attacking people for their skin color? What country is this? You can't control what your skin color is. You can't control your sex is. What the hell? Since when on Martin Luther King day, did people get to go on television and be like, you need a background check because of your skin color. Really? That is grotesque. But not just is it immoral, it will absolutely without question cause a response and that response will be horrible. And we just want to be on tape right now saying those people added to it. They really did. When you attack people, you don't make them less extreme, you make them more extreme. And they know that and they're doing it anyway, which ought to really make you pause. We've lost Jason Whitlock's signal, unfortunately. He is going to come back and join us in just a minute. We'll be happy when he does. We're going to go to break now. We've got new information by the way on the Wuhan virus and where it came from that is really interesting. We will bring you this hour. CARLSON: In just a minute, we're going to have more information about where the coronavirus originally came from, a topic most people don't seem that interested in for some reason, we are. There's new evidence pointing the finger at exactly where we thought it should be pointed and we'll tell you where that is in just a second. But first, we lost Jason Whitlock in our last segment and he is back with us to finish the thought which we like our guests to be able to do. Jason, I'm sorry about that. So you are right in the middle of saying why you think that this is a bad idea, this crackdown. Tell us why. WHITLOCK: Absolutely. Tucker, I just want to repeat again for people to listen to what you said in your monologue and I want to speak specifically to black people and Hispanic people. We have to move beyond race. We have to deal with the facts and not get caught up in the game that's being played on us that we hear everything in racial terms. There is a cultural war going on and it is between those of us who are believers in the American Dream, those of us who are believers in a higher power, those of us who are believers in Dr. King's dream of us being judged by the content of our character and the people who don't believe in those things; the people that want to up turn all the great progress we've made here in America and take us in a direction that is not healthy for any of us. They are using race as a distraction and we're not looking at the corruption we have in this country because of the Chinese influence, the money, how they've overtaken our politicians and Big Tech, and they're trying to destabilize and tear down a great country, a country that is flawed, but it is better than any country on the globe, and has been better for us, those of us that are black than any country on the planet. And yes, it was flawed. But if you go -- if you understand our founding principles, the Declaration of Independence, the Emancipation Proclamation, and Dr. King's speech in ""I Have a Dream"" to me, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King, the three most important men to me in American history, it is all there. CARLSON: Amen. WHITLOCK: They are trying to upturn all of that. Get out of the racial discussion and look at what's really going on in this country. CARLSON: I think that's so true. And the race stuff just short circuits everyone's brain, you get right down to the brainstem, you can't think clearly and that's what they want. And I think you're absolutely right to frame it in those terms. Jason Whitlock, an important voice at this moment. I appreciate your coming on tonight. Thank you. Well, you'll notice one thing about the coronavirus pandemic, it began, scared the heck out of everyone for good reason. We knew it was going to kill a lot of people and it did, but from the very first day, no one was allowed to ask any questions about where it came from. That would be racist and offend the Communist Party of China. We had our suspicions. A lot of much better informed people had their suspicions. We put some of them on this show about where this pandemic originated. Every day brings more evidence that those suspicions were pointing in the right direction. Newly surfaced footage from Chinese state media in 2017, for example, shows researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology being bitten by bats. In a potentially related note, the State Department has determined that workers at the Wuhan lab fell ill with COVID-like symptoms in the fall of 2019. That was weeks before the authorities warned the public about the virus. Dr. Marc Siegel has been following this strain of the story since January. He joins us tonight with an update on what we know. Doctor, good to see you. DR. MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR: A strain of the story, Tucker, very good. Listen, Tucker, you know, the W.H.O. sent 10 scientists from 10 different countries around the world and you know what they are reporting tonight? They think public health measures should have been done earlier. Wow. Such brilliant scientific discovery they have a year later. I wonder if we could have said that, too. But meanwhile, the same night, as you say, reports out of England that researchers from the Wuhan Institute of Virology were in bat caves got bitten through their gloves by bats while they were collecting samples and the same lab, a State Department memo, as you just mentioned, reported that people got sick last fall with COVID-like symptoms. Also, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, according to the State Department, has had plans going with Chinese military since 2016. Well, I'm wondering what do the Chinese military have to do with the Wuhan Institute of Virology? And then it turns out that some of the coronaviruses in this lab, Tucker, are 96 percent similar in structure to SARS-CoV2. So, I'm wondering tonight about why -- I don't wonder why Chinese scientists would suppress information. I don't wonder about that. But I do wonder why in the United States, we wouldn't be looking at this a little more closely. I think I smell a rat here, or is it a bat, Tucker? CARLSON: I don't think we want to know. But we do, I know you do, too, and I appreciate that. Dr. Siegel, great to see you tonight. Thank you. SIEGEL: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: So the President of the United States has a about a full workday left in his term and during that time, he is considering pardons in his final hours in office. We will tell you who is on the list and who may be left off. Really the last truly significant act as President happens tomorrow. Pamela Anderson joins us to weigh in on what she thinks should happen. We'll be right back. CARLSON: Well, it doesn't happen that much when everyone in Washington agrees with one another on something, but when it does -- oh. When Democrats, Republicans and the media all sound alike, all sing the same song from the same hymnal, when Nancy Pelosi talks about Venezuela and coups like the neocon she actually is, you ought to be nervous about that. Institutional Washington is by far at its most dangerous when there's consensus, when it stops reflecting the will of the voters and starts defending its own interests without any opposition whatsoever. There may be no issue that unites the establishment wings of both political parties, other than fighting pointless wars, more than this issue, and here it is. Leaking classified information that hurts the permanent political class is a grave threat to national security and must be stamped out, but leaking classified information that helps the permanent political class is an act of good faith, son, you're getting a Pulitzer for that. So there was no problem when the F.B.I. told ""The Washington Post"" that that diabolical Vladimir Putin was secretly running our government. That was a lie, but not a problem. When the C.I.A. Director gave classified information to the producers of ""Zero Dark Thirty"" because that's Hollywood, and they are our friends. But when those leaks implicate the people in charge, oh, it's a national crisis and someone needs to go to jail, and often, people do go to jail. Julian Assange, for example. He is rotting away in a prison in London right now. Why? He published information that the U.S. government wanted to keep secret not to protect us, but to protect themselves. Footage of an American helicopter gunning down 18 people in Iraq, including, by the way two journalist from Reuters. He also publicized e- mails exposing corruption at the very highest levels of the D.N.C. Bernie Sanders voters may have been grateful for that, they got completely shafted and wouldn't have known it, now, they do. And that infuriated the people who ran Washington. Just to be clear, Julian Assange did not hack servers at the U.S. Army, The Pentagon, or the D.N.C. know. He reported on those servers. That's called journalism, which, by the way, real journalism, not much left, it is all under attack, trust us. So for doing that, for humiliating both our elected leaders and the media class, Julian Assange's life has been destroyed. He's been locked away for almost a decade. This case is not about espionage. He didn't commit espionage. He's not a traitor. He's not American. This case is about criminalizing freedom of speech. The mother of Julian Assange's children came on this show last year and made that point very succinctly. Watch.  STELLA MORRIS, JULIAN ASSANGE' S FIANCEE: Julian's is the foremost perhaps the foremost free speech campaigner alive in the West and he is imprisoned, and does the President want that to be his legacy or does he want to, you know, ensure that the First Amendment survives this trial and survives by pardoning him and not having this trial. CARLSON: No one who works on this show ever imagined we'd be where we are now, which is in effect defending Julian Assange. But the truth is, we're not defending Julian Assange, we're defending something that is actually under attack that is actually precious to every American and that is going away faster than we ever thought it could and that's the freedom of speech. He reported things they don't like, they threw him in jail. If it happened to him, why couldn't it happen to you again? Speak slowly so we can understand. And if that doesn't convince you, consider the case of another person we have also had on the show quite a bit, a very decent man, by the way, called John Kiriakou. He's a 15-year veteran of the C.I.A. He led some of the military's most important raids in Pakistan during his career. He risked his life for the country. But then in 2007, he did something that destroyed his life, he confirmed something on the record that no one else in government was willing to admit at the time that the U.S. Army was in fact waterboarding and torturing prisoners. Now, you may support that or you may not, but if you're an American citizen who pays for all this stuff, why don't you have a right to know that? Now, the D.O.J. at the time did not think John Kiriakou committed a crime, what he said was true. He was treated as a whistleblower, which he was, agree with him or not. But five years later, the C.I.A., which was still furious about it, told the Obama administration which is in the habit of obeying the C.I.A. to reopen that case and punish John Kiriakou, so they did. And of course, they found a crime. It is not hard for prosecutors to find a crime when they are bent on retribution meant to encourage the others. So John Kiriakou went to prison for two years. He can no longer to this day, a man who served his country for 15 years, defend his family with a firearm because he is a convicted felon. They gave him his voting rights back, but not the right to defend his family. So here's why we're telling you this. The President, on his last day in office is expected to announce a series of pardons before he leaves on Wednesday. Some news reports tell us that he will pardon the rapper Lil Wayne, on a firearms charge. We don't know if that's true or not. We don't even have an opinion on that. What we do know, if he wants a lasting historical effect on this country in the closing days of his administration, he can achieve a major victory for the principles that this country was founded on and that make it a good place to live, and the first one of those is freedom of the press, freedom of speech. No one else in the media feels like arguing for it, it doesn't matter. It's still true and we should still defend it and he should pardon Julian Assange and he should pardon John Kiriakou. Pamela Anderson is an actress. She's also pretty well versed and very well versed on the subject. She's been in close contact with Julian Assange and we thought we'd like to hear from her tonight. Pamela Anderson, thank you for coming on. Why should the President pardon Julian Assange? PAMELA ANDERSON, ACTRESS: Thank you. Well, like he said, it is this freedom of the press, freedom of speech, if we don't have that, we don't have a democracy. And I really thank you for what you're saying. And I think like you said, this is a defining moment for the President. This is, the entire world wants him to pardon or most of the world wants him to pardon Julian Assange. This would mean -- this is why he is President. This is, I think, the defining moment, this is his time to shine to really make an impression on the world that this was freedom of speech. Because if this goes to trial, that's the end of the First Amendment, and I just think that this is so serious, and so important that he needs to -- that pardon is sitting on his desk and I'm sure there's a lot going on behind the scenes where people are maybe bullying him a little bit, because, you know, there's impeachment and there are a couple of probably cranky Republican senators that are negotiating with us, and he needs to do the right thing. This is one of those moments in history and his lifetime, too that he needs to make the right decision. And so it's all up to, you know, President Trump, but he would really gain a huge following and a huge sigh of relief and gratefulness for so many people on the planet. And I just think that this is so important, and this is something he needs to do. He absolutely needs to do this, and I'm just saying, just do it, you know -- it is so important to free speech. He's a free speech hero. CARLSON: I think -- I think the principle is worth defending and I appreciate your coming on tonight. Pamela Anderson, thank you. ANDERSON: Thank you. CARLSON: Pardon Lil Wayne? Some Medicare fraud criminal from Florida? Don't degrade yourself on the way out. Don't degrade your voters. Make a statement in our defense. Defend the Bill of Rights. Joe Biden's inauguration is less than 48 hours from now. We'll have more coverage on that, next. CARLSON: And like that, an hour is gone. We're out of time. The one thing you can't get back, sadly. But we'll be back tomorrow, the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. Have the best night with the ones you love. Sean Hannity from New York takes over now. Classification"
2021-02-26,"TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to a Special Edition of TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. It was a year ago this week that Nancy Pelosi was walking the streets of San Francisco's Chinatown without any concern whatsoever for her personal safety. Nancy Pelosi's face was stark naked. She wasn't wearing a mask, neither were the dozens of people who surrounded her. A local CBS affiliate was on the scene following all of it, but even the coronavirus was already spreading all over the world in places like France and South Korea and we now know here in the U.S., CBS didn't suggest that anything was amiss. They didn't report that Nancy Pelosi was a walking biohazard or a super spreader. And why would they think that? Just days earlier, Tony Fauci had gone on television and promised Americans that the risk of coronavirus infection in this country was quote, ""miniscule."" So, if Tony Fauci's word meant anything and at the time, people thought that it did, Nancy Pelosi's walk around Chinatown wasn't alarming, it was heroic. As when CBS News reporter put it, Nancy Pelosi was a walking one woman tourist attraction on a mission to defeat a pathogen far more insidious than the coronavirus. Nancy Pelosi was in Chinatown to defeat racism against Asian-Americans. Pelosi herself was explicit on that point, quote, ""We want to say to people come to Chinatown. Here we are. We're careful. We're safe. Come join us."" In other words, if you're worried about catching the virus by gathering in a big crowd in Chinatown, that means you're a white supremacist. So, one year after that remarkable day, what have we learned? Well, for one thing, we know that despite her very best efforts, Nancy Pelosi did not succeed in extinguishing anti-racism -- racism against Asians in San Francisco. In fact, a year later violence against Asian-Americans in San Francisco is at the highest rate ever. So, if you're a reasonable person, you might call for an investigation into this: what's causing these attacks? How can we stop them? But if you tune in to CNN or MSNBC, you already know why they're happening. Donald Trump. Yes, the great orange menace may not be in the White House anymore, he may not have gotten any votes at all in San Francisco, but don't be fooled. Donald Trump is the reason this is happening. And that sends a larger message to the rest of us from our political class and their servants in the media. Never blame the people in charge. That's a familiar refrain. We've heard it a lot over the last 12 months, and for the most part, it has worked. Propaganda usually does, and that's why we're going to spend the next hour highlighting the politicians and the bureaucrats who have not been held accountable for what they did to this country during the pandemic. They've ruined lives. They've destroyed businesses. They caused people to die. But if you confront them on any of these questions, they will tell you reflexively, it's someone else's fault. No single politician has used this tactic more often or more shamelessly, as the Governor of New York State, Andrew Cuomo. Cuomo accepted an Emmy award last year for performances like these when the pandemic was beginning last spring. GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): ... strategy, plan of action all along. Step one, flatten the curve. In other words, we're all talking about this curve, flatten the curve. We're trying to flatten the curve. And we have to flatten the curve. We've reduced the rate, we so-called, flattened the curve. Flatten the curve. CARLSON: Flatten the curve, flatten the curve. We did it. We flattened the curve. Boy, that's a great slogan. What does it mean exactly? What is flattening the curve? Well, not many people bothered to ask that question. For New Yorkers last year, flatten the curve became the new version of 15 days to slow the spread. Just a series of words arranged in order so politicians can repeat them over and over to convey the impression they were in charge and doing something to fix the problem. In reality, Andrew Cuomo spent most of his time sitting for interviews with his brother over on CNN, and having staffers write a book under his name. That book was called ""American Crisis: Leadership Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic."" Well, we took a look at some of the top customer reviews for the book on amazon.com, people actually read it. Here's the top review right now, quote: ""A heartfelt and caring look at how it feels to murder people through bureaucratic ineptitude."" Here's the next review on amazon.com at the moment, quote: ""Governor Cuomo's self-serving book raises embarrassing questions. Politicians being human make mistakes, Andrew Cuomo, as scientists agree, made a serious error that led to thousands of unnecessary tragic deaths in nursing homes. Shouldn't a politician like Cuomo have a moral obligation to admit his error, even as in this case, it is likely to lead him losing his position, his chance to be President of the United States and lawsuits?"" Well, that's a good question. Doesn't he have a moral obligation to do that? As that reviewer noted, in March of last year, Andrew Cuomo ordered nursing homes in the state to admit patients who had tested positive for the coronavirus. Then Cuomo's administration hid the total number of nursing home deaths that resulted from that order. We're not speculating about that, one of his staffers admitted they did it. But Andrew Cuomo himself still has not acknowledged that he did this or any wrongdoing whatsoever, and said last week, he blamed the people who work in nursing homes. CUOMO: COVID did not get into the nursing homes by people coming from hospitals. COVID got into the nursing homes by staff walking into the nursing home. CARLSON: So case closed. I am not responsible for the 11,000 nursing home deaths in New York or the coordinated effort to cover up those deaths. You know who is responsible? The nurses, the receptionist making 35 grand a year, they must suffer. Their lives must be ruined so that Andrew Cuomo can keep his job and his Emmy Award. But we don't mean to single out Andrew Cuomo. He is not the only incompetent politician who needs to save face and will lie and hurt others in order to do it. Our public health experts are scrambling to avoid humiliation too, and there's a lot of it waiting for them. And if that means isolating the most vulnerable members of our society even more than they've already been isolated, then that's the cost. It's collateral damage. It's a price they're willing to pay because they don't pay it. This is a real article published by NBC News earlier this month. It lays out word for word. We're reading from it verbatim. Quote, ""After grandparents or older parents received the coronavirus vaccine, can you visit them? The answer is likely no. But it depends. One expert from Northwestern University said essentially nothing changes after the vaccine."" End quote. Again, nothing changes after the vaccine. It's hard to believe they're saying this and it's not just one so-called expert from Northwestern saying that. Tony Fauci himself is saying it, too, quote: ""Until we have the overwhelming majority of people vaccinated and the level of virus is very low,"" Fauci said this month, "" ... you probably shouldn't visit your grandparents without your mask on. It's just too early to be doing something that reckless."" human contact with the ones you love most. Breaking people out of their prisons of solitude, don't dare, even after the vaccine. Tony Fauci wants to take it slow. On the other hand, Fauci is still capable of acting very, very quickly, as long as the right interests are involved, as long as he is profiting from it or his allies are. We'll give you one of many examples. Tony Fauci has already decided without any hesitation whatsoever, that the World Health Organization deserves billions of your money right away, U.S. tax dollars. Now, the World Health Organization is the group that could have warned the rest of the world about the pandemic, could have saved lives, but chose instead to repeat Chinese propaganda instead. Your grandmother can wait, according to Tony Fauci, but bureaucrats at W.H.O.'s headquarters in Switzerland need the cash and they need it now. DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: I join my fellow representatives in thanking the World Health Organization for its role in leading the global public health response to this pandemic. And as such, I am honored to announce that the United States will remain a member of the World Health Organization. CARLSON: What a malignant buffoon. History will indeed his behavior. So you're still waiting for your stimulus check, the W.H.O. is not waiting for their money, they're getting it. But it's not just W.H.O. According to ""The Daily Caller,"" the lab in Wuhan where this pandemic likely started, the Wuhan Institute of Virology will continue to receive American taxpayer funding for the next several years. It's hard to believe that's real. It is. Tony Fauci himself has supported research at that lab. It's enough to blow your mind. Again, the people responsible for this pandemic aren't facing consequences. Instead, they are getting U.S. tax dollars. The consequences fall where they always do: on the American middle class. So if you unleash a deadly virus on the world or cause thousands of deaths in nursing homes or fail to warn the world in order to appease your masters in China, you get millions. But if you're just a waitress in Brooklyn dealing with the fallout of all of this and you step out of line for a moment, you're done.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice over): The 34-year-old says she was fired after telling her employer she and her husband are considering starting a family and she had hesitations about getting the COVID-19 vaccine. QUESTION: Do you think it's fair for a workplace to be able to determine whether or not its employees should be vaccinated? BONNIE JACOBSON, WAITRESS FIRED BY EMPLOYER FOR REFUSING COVID-19 VACCINE: I don't. I don't. You know, especially in a situation like mine, I asked for a little more time. That's a very legitimate reason. CARLSON: Yes, this is someone who doesn't oppose the vaccines, who is thankful for vaccines, like most Americans, but who simply has questions. That's the person who is suffering. Is that fair? No. But it's happening everywhere. The people in charge of this country, your politicians, your bosses, the public health experts, especially Bill Gates, all of a sudden they have more power than they've ever had, including over your personal life, certainly over the lives of your children. They can't go outside or attend class in many states right now. But don't worry, it's for their own good. Randi Weingarten is the President of the American Federation of Teachers. That's the second largest teachers union in the country. She's not a doctor. She's not a scientist. She's a lawyer. But according to Randi Weingarten, medically speaking, your kids shouldn't be anywhere near a school. DAN PRIMACK, BUSINESS EDITOR, AXIOS: Is there a point in which kids have been out of physical in-person school for so long that the education that they've lost isn't really recoverable? The third grade, the fourth grade, the kindergarten they lost, they can take extra semesters in the summer, they can do -- but it can't really be fixed? RANDI WEINGARTEN, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TEACHERS: No. I don't believe that. I believe that kids are resilient and kids will recover. CARLSON: Really? Randi Weingarten, how many kids do you have? Kids are resilient. They'll recover. Yet another promise we've heard during this pandemic. Get the vaccine, your life will return to normal. That wasn't true. Why should we believe any of this is true? And who's going to be held responsible for these lies? We're going to spend the next hour investigating all of that. You're going to hear from people who've been hurt along the way. But we want to start tonight by talking with Charlie Hurt of ""The Washington Times."" Charlie, great to see you. CHARLIE HURT, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Great to see you, Tucker. CARLSON: So that kind of is the question. I mean, I don't think any decent person seeks vengeance for its own sake, but I do think it's important in order to illustrate what's right and what's wrong, and that, you know, malicious bad decisions have consequences that the people who made those decisions are somehow held accountable for them. When will that happen? HURT: I don't know. But, you know, right now, you look across you see a sea of incompetence and failure by the government. And I challenge you to find me one single thing, one single decision our government has made, or people in power have made that has done anything other than amass more power and more money for themselves, take power and money from us, and give it to them. And you could -- they could counter and say, well, what about the stimulus checks? We gave you $600.00. First of all, that $600.00 was mine to begin with. So I'm not really all that grateful for it. But that $600.00 pales in comparison to the billions and billions of dollars, trillions of dollars that they want to -- in debt -- that they want to put on us to pay themselves. And what do they do with that money? They build a huge wall around the Capitol to protect themselves from us. They want to give billions to the W.H.O., which as you point out, is a failure and is in bed with China. And they want to give -- and this one is one that really sticks out to me. They want to give $129 billion to government schools, which have failed to figure out how to open safely. Why don't they give that money back to the parents who have had to act like teachers, have had to play that role for the past year? Why don't they give that money to Christian schools -- Catholic schools around the country that opened up two weeks after this whole thing started and have never shut down and they have done it successfully and they've done it safely. And nobody -- and people have not gotten -- and the pandemic has not struck down millions of these people. It's been -- it has been a -- they have succeeded where the government has failed. And when you look at the only bright spot in all of this, the only bright spot is perhaps the vaccines, and how did we get the vaccines? We got the vaccine because the government has stepped out of the way and gave private enterprise the room, the leeway, the lack of red tape to sort of do all this stuff. But yet, the only solution to these people is to amass more power and more money for themselves and to take it away from us. CARLSON: See, it's such a smart analysis. It's absolutely correct. Provably so, this is a power grab. I wish we'd all known it earlier. Charlie Hurt, I appreciate your analysis. Thank you. HURT: Thank you, Tucker. CARLSON: So the theme the thread that runs through all of this is the people in power when corona began are more powerful, everyone else is much less. The burden is falling on them. We mentioned a waitress in New York City who was fired for declining to take the corona vaccine, we will speak to her straight ahead. CARLSON: Until recently, Bonnie Jacobson worked in a restaurant in New York City. She's hardly an anti-vaxxer whatever that is. She's for vaccines. She thinks they save lives. But Bonnie Jacobson wanted to hold off for a moment in taking this vaccine. She wanted to know more about it. She was concerned it might affect her fertility. And for making that decision over her own body, Bonnie Jacobson was fired from her job at the Red Hook Tavern in Brooklyn. An amazing story. Bonnie Jacobson joins us now with her attorney David Cassidy. Thanks both for coming on. Bonnie, I appreciate, first to you, you're coming on. The reason why I talk to you is seem so reasonable in the clip that I saw of you. You said, I'm not against vaccines, but I just got married. I might like to have children. I have questions. When you said that, I assume you said that to your bosses at the Red Hook Tavern. What did they say? JACOBSON: Yes, well, hi. And thank you for having me on and allowing me to tell my story, because I think it's an important one. So yes, originally, they had said that the vaccine was not going to be mandatory, and I got an e-mail all of a sudden changing course telling me that it was now going to be mandatory. And even when I got that e-mail, I figured it was still open to a conversation. So you know, I e-mailed back just expressing my concerns over fertility. You know, even in that e-mail, I said that I understand the vaccine is important, I know why it's important. Once there's more research, I would be open to changing my stance on it. And I would also be happy to speak to them more about it in person. Also, I think it's very important to mention I gave an alternative option. I said, I would continue to get tested regularly, I would continue to wear my mask. You know, practice all the C.D.C. safety guidelines, in the meantime, thinking that we could just continue a conversation and instead, on Monday, I got an e-mail back from them, saying that my employment at this time was terminated while they respect my choices. CARLSON: David Cassidy, as her attorney, I'm just wondering the obvious question. Is it legal to force people to take about any vaccine, but particularly this vaccine? DAVID CASSIDY, ATTORNEY: Well, Tucker, thank you for having us. I want to make clear that this is not a political agenda here by our client, that this is a personal choice. CARLSON: Right. It doesn't sound like it. CASSIDY: But legally speaking, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has said that mandatory vaccine policies can be legal subject to a few exemptions, such as someone having a medical disability or a religious objection. We feel that this particular termination of employment was unlawful because our client invoked issues of pregnancy and fertility, which are also protected areas under the law. This firing was neither fair. It wasn't necessary. It was unlawful, quite frankly. Our client asked for a little bit of time to get some data, to see a medical doctor, to understand the risks and they did not allow her that time. It wasn't necessary, this termination, because as you have pointed out, it doesn't change anything. The only person being protected by a vaccine, according to the C.D.C. and the public health officials is the person receiving it. So our client was willing to employ the necessary protocols to remain working. CARLSON: Amazing. I hope you both take this as far through the system as you can. I think a lot of people -- and it's not political, you're right -- are rooting for you, because clearly you're within your rights. I appreciate you coming on. Thank you. JACOBSON: Absolutely. Thank you so much. CASSIDY: Thank you, Tucker. CARLSON: You'll notice you've got total freedom of choice when it comes to ending a pregnancy, but if you have concerns about starting one about fertility. No. Interesting. Well, Patsy's Italian Restaurant was one of the most iconic restaurants in New York, but since coronavirus, New York's leaders have done everything they can to destroy it and businesses like it. And sadly, they're succeeding. Patsy's Italian is now leaving New York and moving to New Jersey. Sal Scognamillo is the owner of Patsy's. He joins us tonight to explain what happened. Sal, I appreciate your coming on. What a sad story. You've been in New York, I think -- how long has your restaurant been in New York actually? SAL SCOGNAMILLO, OWNER, PATSY' S ITALIAN RESTAURANT: Seventy seven years and just to be clear, we're not -- we're not going to be leaving permanently. I plan on coming back and reopening when the city gets a plan for us right now. And we're doing a pop up restaurant in Asbury Park, New Jersey. And that's for February, March and April right now. It's been going very well. And I love New York and I'm rooting for New York. New York is the epicenter of education, finance, the arts, so many different things. And you know, we need a plan for New York to come back. You know, my wife likes to use the word opportunity. So we had the opportunity to go to Asbury Park, New Jersey, and the way that came about was, I have a friend of mine who lives in a town very close by, Spring Lake, New Jersey. His name is John Fudge, and I called him up and I said what do you know about Asbury Park? A few people have been saying to me, it's a wonderful place. It's only 60 miles from New York City. And my friend, John Fudge, happened to be a child of that era. He his father had a store in Asbury Park, and he knew it very well. And in two and a half months, it's quite miraculous, we were able to put together a deal with the Manzo family. They're from the Real Housewives of New Jersey. They're doing the food and beverage at the Berkeley Hotel in Asbury Park, and a few words, one led to the other and the patriarch Al Manzo has been coming to my restaurant for 30 to 40 years and he said, I'd love to have you down here. And we opened just a few weeks ago, and I have to tell you, the response has been overwhelmingly positive. Everyone wants us to stay there. They think it's a great thing. And we've been very, very busy. I always try and look for solutions, and the solution for New York is we have to get opportunity back to New York. They need to get incentives for people to come back. CARLSON: Well, of course. SCOGNAMILLO: To travel, to come and stay at the hotels. CARLSON: I mean, if Patsy's leaves -- sorry, wrap it up for me. Your issue is? SCOGNAMILLO: Well, my issue is that you know, you have the 1.4 percent is the spread in, you know, in the same -- in the restaurants and bars. And you have 74 percent living room spread. Now, you have Manhattan, which has consistently been one of the lowest rates of infection in the entire State of New York, and it's closed. And then you have upstate New York and Nassau and Suffolk County, and it's a much higher rate of infection, and it's open. So I mean, what is it? You're not going to get the virus when you're in in Long Island or upstate New York, but you won't get it when you're in New York City? It just didn't make sense to me. Fifty percent of the space is - - CARLSON: Well, it never makes sense. It never made sense. Well, Sal, I appreciate coming on tonight. And I appreciate your restaurant. I've gained a lot of weight there. Thank you. SCOGNAMILLO: Well, we will be back. Don't give up on New York yet. CARLSON: Good. Okay. Thank you. Well, a lot of so-called public health experts including Dr. Fauci are now recommending you wear multiple masks, two, even three. Is that good for you? Honestly? To reduce oxygen flow? We're going to take a sober look at that question after the break. KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Live from ""America's News Headquarters,"" I'm Kevin Corke. The U.S. House of Representatives expecting to burn the midnight oil, quite frankly, debating President Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 Relief Bill. A final vote could come early Saturday morning. That relief package aimed at stabilizing the economy and boosting coronavirus vaccinations and testing. Republicans say the bill is simply too expensive, but Democrats say they are confident they can pass the bill. House passage would send that legislation over to the Senate where a bigger fight awaits. Johnson & Johnson's single shot vaccine is one step closer to emergency approval, a panel of health experts endorsing the vaccine today. The F.D.A. says it will quickly follow the recommendations and authorize the J&J vaccine for emergency use if authorized. A few million doses could be shipped out as early as Monday. I'm Kevin Corke in Washington. Now back to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. CARLSON: Well, no public health official has done more to undermine faith in the coronavirus vaccine than Tony Fauci has. Instead of telling Americans that life can go back to normal once they're vaccinated, which was the whole point, Fauci is saying the opposite. Earlier this month, Fauci suggested you might want to wear two or three face masks, even after you've gotten the shot. FAUCI: But you wear a mask, then you want it to fit better. So one of the ways you could do it, if you would like to, is put a cloth mask over, we can actually hear and here and here where you could get leakage in is much better contained. CARLSON: That's lunatic and actual scientists have pointed this out. One physician at Rutgers Medical School, David Cennimo, was asked about triple masking and here was his response, quote: ""That's so crazy, I don't even know how to address it."" End quote. Alex Berenson is the author of ""Unreported Truths about COVID-19 Part 3: Masks."" He joins us tonight. Alex Berenson, thanks so much for coming on. Very simple question, which I don't think Google will allow you to ask, but we will. Is it healthy to wear three masks on your face? ALEX BERENSON, AUTHOR: I mean, Tucker, first of all, I want to very quickly say thank you because the last time I was on with you it was the week the ""Power Couple"" had been published, and we talked a little bit about how, you know, I couldn't get reviews and sort of being shut out because my nonfiction work, my novel was suffering. You, you know, you said something about it, and you almost -- I don't want to give you too much credit, but you almost single handedly turned around the publication. We became a bestseller that week on the Publishers Weekly bestseller list. So thank you on that. Now -- CARLSON: People appreciate your bravery. BERENSON: I think they listened to you actually. But masks and a little bit vaccines, okay. We don't need to -- we don't really need to argue about whether three masks might be dangerous. There's no evidence that three masks do any good. There's very, very little evidence that two masks or one mask do any good. There's one good clinical trial about masks and the coronavirus, it came out in November. It's been very conveniently memory hold by the media since then and what it showed was very clear: masks do not protect the wearer from the coronavirus. Okay. So in the face of that both before and after that, the C.D.C. and various other places have come up with a bunch of theories about how masks, you know or source control and my mask protects you even if it doesn't protect me although maybe it does protect me and although it doesn't really because there's no evidence that it actually does. And here's what you -- when you look and you try to graph mask mandates on a sort of national or regional or local level against changes in the coronavirus overtime, against changes in infection rates, you find absolutely no comparison. No way to track any -- that there's any relationship, okay? So if you look at California versus Florida, that's one that people like to show because California, heavy mask mandates. You know lockdowns, lots of rules. Florida went exactly the opposite way. The virus essentially behaved exactly the same in both places. Okay, so in the face of all this evidence, what the C.D.C. has done is ridiculous. They've said, oh, well, it may not be one mask, maybe we need two masks, or maybe three masks. And the pivotal C.D.C. study on this, which came out a few weeks ago was done on mannequins. So if you're a mannequin, maybe two masks will help you, but if you're a human being, there's basically no evidence that this does any good. CARLSON: Alex Berenson, thank you, again. BERENSON: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: Appreciate it. Well, according to C.D.C., the life expectancy of American has declined by a full year from 78.8 to 77.7 years old in the first half of 2020. That's the largest drop in life expectancy in this country since we were in World War II. There was a reason for that, people were getting killed. The C.D.C. found that many of those deaths were not caused by coronavirus. They were classified as, quote, ""deaths of despair."" They were deaths from overdoses and suicides. Deaths of despair went up more than 20 percent during the COVID lockdowns. The C.D.C. recorded more fatal overdoses in a single year 81,000 than ever -- ever. Johann Hari is the author of ""Lost Connections."" He's thought a lot about despair and how to solve it. He joins us. We're always happy to have him on. Johann, thanks for coming tonight. JOHANN HARI, AUTHOR, ""LOST CONNECTIONS"": Hi, Tucker. Thanks for having me. CARLSON: Were you surprised by this? And I know the answer, you weren't. What can we do about this? This is so sad. HARI: You're so right that there's this epidemic of despair that has been rising for very long time. And one of the things that's so important to understand is this doesn't have to happen. For the research for my books, I went to places that had problems as big as this and turned it around, and the United States can do the same thing. I'll give you a specific example. In the year 2000, Portugal had the worst drug problem in the world. One percent of the population was addicted to heroin, which is mind blowing. And every year, they tried the war on drugs more. They arrested more people. They shamed and imprisoned more people. And every year, the problem got worse, until finally, they were forced to do something different. They decided -- and it sounds really bold when you first hear it, they decided to decriminalize all drugs, but -- and this was the crucial next step -- they took all the money they used to spend on shaming, punishing and imprisoning people, and instead spent it on very practical ways of turning their lives around, mostly getting them jobs. Portugal went from having the worst drug problem in Europe, to the least level of overdoses in the entire European Union. Everywhere in the world that has tried policies based on helping people and helping them reconnect with a normal life sees a big fall in despair, and a big fall in overdose addictions and suicides. It's not rocket science, right? If you make people's lives worse, they're more likely to be addicted and they are more likely to despair and commit suicide. And if you give them very practical help in targeted ways for things like work, community, social connection, it massively reduces these problems. The opposite of addiction is connection. We need to help people to reconnect. That's why the book is called ""Lost Connections."" CARLSON: So if you restore meaning and purpose to people's lives, they don't want to kill themselves. HARI: That's exactly right. I mean, to your grandmother and my grandmother, that would have sounded very obvious, but what we've done is we've told these other stories, which have some truth in them. We've said that, you know, depression is just a problem in people's brains or addiction is just a question of needing a chemical. And of course, there's some truth in those questions. But there's much more basic truth here. Human beings have needs. You need to be seen by other people, you need to have friends, and you need to have a sense of purpose. You need to have meaningful work. And if you look at what's happened in the United States and across the Western world, we have stripped people of those things. Forty percent of Americans agree with the statement, ""No one knows me well."" After a factory shuts down in a town, the suicide rate and the opioid overdose rate doubles over the next few years. This isn't rocket science. Your grandmother would have understood intuitively why that was the case. And everywhere in the world I went for my books, I learned one thing. The most effective strategies for dealing with depression and anxiety and addiction are the ones that deal with the reasons why we feel this way in the first place. These deaths do not have to happen. Of course, there's always going to be some despair. But this enormous epidemic of despair doesn't have to be happening. There are very practical solutions for individuals and for countries. I've seen them in practice. We need to start choosing them, not policies that make the problem worse like the drug war. CARLSON: Amen. Johann Hari, great to see you tonight. Thank you. HARI: Great to talk to you, Tucker. CARLSON: So you're promised a coronavirus stimulus check. Now, wherever you are on the question of stimulus check, they did promise it to you. You haven't gotten it, but they are spending your money to reward the people who may have caused the coronavirus pandemic in the first place, just in case it couldn't get more insulting. Apparently it can, we've got to tell straight ahead. CARLSON: Well, since the very beginning of the corona mess, the World Health Organization has functioned like an arm of Chinese state media, which effectively it has become. In February, for example, the Director of W.H.O. announced that thanks to the Chinese Communist Party, we have nothing to fear from the coronavirus. DR. TEDROS ADHANOM, DIRECTOR GENERAL, WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION: I was so impressed in my meeting with President Xi at his detailed knowledge of the outbreak. There is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade. CARLSON: It's hilarious, but it didn't stop. In March, for example, a reporter with a Hong Kong news station interviewed the Assistant Director General at W.H.O., a doctor called Bruce Aylward. The reporter asked Aylward whether the W.H.O. would recognize Taiwan's independence. It doesn't seem complicated, it is a health agency. Why do they care? Their job is to help people no matter what country they're at, but the W.H.O. decided not to upset the Chinese Communist Party, to tow the party line. So Bruce Aylward pretended he couldn't hear the question. QUESTION: Will the W.H.O. reconsider Taiwan's membership? Hello? BRUCE AYLWARD, ASSISTANT DIRECTOR GENERAL, WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION: I'm sorry, I couldn't hear your question. QUESTION: Let me -- let me repeat the question. AYLWARD: That's okay. Let's move to another one, then. QUESTION: Right. Because I'm actually curious on talking about Taiwan as well on Taiwan's case. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We decided to give Dr. Aylward another call to follow up. QUESTION: And I just want to see if you can comment a bit on how Taiwan has done so far in terms of containing the virus? AYLWARD: Well, we've already talked about China. And, you know, when you look across all the different areas of China, they've actually all done quite a good job. So with that, I'd like to thank you very much for inviting us to participate and, and good luck as you go forward with the battle in Hong Kong. CARLSON: Oh, that's the greatest tape ever. What a worm. If only we had reporters like that in our country. Why are reporters in Hong Kong willing to ask a question more than once? Interesting. Stephen Mosher is the author of ""Bully of Asia: Why China's Dream is the New Threat to the World Order."" He joins us tonight. Mr. Mosher, thanks so much for coming on. STEPHEN MOSHER, AUTHOR, ""BULLY OF ASIA"": Hi, Tucker. CARLSON: So it does seem like the World Health Organization has never really established independence from a chief patron, China. MOSHER: Oh, absolutely not. I mean, and this is playing politics with people's lives, Tucker. Think about this. Taiwan saw the danger early from China because all danger in Taiwan, well, most of it anyway, comes from China. So they're always watching across the Taiwan Straits to see what evil lurks on the Mainland. And they saw the Wuhan virus coming. They closed their borders earlier than any country in the world. They realized there was human to human transmission. They tried to warn the World Health Organization about this danger and they were ignored. The World Health Organization did not read their e-mails, did not take their phone calls. And so again, this is playing politics with people's lives. If the World Health Organization had truly been concerned about the health of the world, they would listen to all the information coming in, especially from people sitting on China's very doorstep and watching the pandemic materialize in real time. CARLSON: So a so-called Health Organization allowing people to die for political reasons. It's hard to think of corruption deeper than that, why would we send them money? MOSHER: Why indeed? I mean, we're now getting ready to repeat the same mistakes of the past by sending them $200 million -- $200 million for what? For failing to protect the health of the world, which is their mandate, right? They're called the World Health Organization. Maybe they should be called the China Health Organization. But think about the fact that early on, Dr. Tedros, you just played the clip was going to China and singing the praises of the Chinese Communist Party's leader, Xi Jinping saying what a wonderful job they were doing in coping with the pandemic. They hid human to human transmission from us. They downplayed the danger of the pandemic. And then, of course, they've just sent in to China this delegation of 12 people who came back and said, well, it wasn't -- it wasn't the lab. It didn't come from the lab, when clearly we know that it probably did. More and more people agree with that. CARLSON: It certainly seems likely that it did, and anyone who tells you out of hand it didn't, we know, is obviously lying. Stephen Mosher, great to see you tonight. Thank you. MOSHER: Good to see you. CARLSON: So it's a close contest, who's the most incompetent and dangerous governor in the United States? Is it Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan? Is it that Pritzker guy in Illinois? It's probably Andrew Cuomo. He does have competition though. The stories of our leaders' untold incompetence, straight ahead. CARLSON: Well, we spend an awful lot of time in the show talking about the Governor of New York State, Andrew Cuomo and we have reasons for that. Cuomo was responsible effectively for thousands of deaths in New York and then covering up those deaths by lying. But it's easy to forget that Andrew Cuomo is not alone. He is not the only governor in this country to demonstrate total and utter incompetence and corruption over the past year. He's got some stiff competition. In Michigan, Governor Gretchen Whitmer has also done everything she can to encourage people to move to Florida. She is basically Florida's realtor in chief. First, she issued a stay-at-home lockdown order that didn't apply to her own family. That became obvious just before Memorial Day weekend when her husband really felt the need to get in his boat. So he called up a marina and casually mentioned, ""My wife is the governor."" When he was caught doing this, Whitmer claimed her husband was just joking around, right? But she kept going, Gretchen Whitmer. She continued to issue more nonsensical lockdown orders, none of which she had an interest in following herself. GOV. GRETCHEN WHITMER (D-MI): If you are considering spending Thanksgiving with people outside of your household, I urge you to reconsider. And I hate to say it, but we know that some people will gather anyway. And odds are that some of these gatherings will spread COVID and contribute to the loss of loved ones. CARLSON: So just two months after delivering the warning, you just saw, Gretchen Whitmer took her walk daughters to Washington and was surrounded by people outside of her household. She was cavorting with strangers. As everyone knows, especially California Governor Gavin Newsom, that is the one thing you absolutely can never do. GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D-CA): I want to remind you to limit your mixing with people outside of your household. It's just commonsense. But the data suggests not everybody is practicing commonsense. CARLSON: Yes, the data suggests not everyone is practicing commonsense. Of course, you'll recall that Gavin Newsom himself was caught at America's most expensive restaurant in Napa in this infamous photograph. How long until everyone in California and New York gets tired of this hypocrisy and move to Florida? Karol Markowicz is a ""New York Post"" columnist. She currently resides in Florida. And that tells you a lot. Karol Markowicz, I appreciate your coming on tonight. KAROL MARKOWICZ, COLUMNIST, ""NEW YORK POST"": Thank you. CARLSON: So these governors have driven the single largest internal migration in this country since the Great Depression. I mean, you really can't hold them responsible for it. Can you not? MARKOWICZ: Oh, yes, absolutely you can hold them responsible. It would be one thing if their terrible lockdowns actually worked. But Michigan, Massachusetts, New York, obviously, New Jersey, Rhode Island, they all saw more deaths per capita than the more open states like Texas and Florida. California has the most deaths overall, and they are quickly approaching the Florida numbers per capita. So what did they win? What did they win by destroying the economy, not letting kids go to school and just, you know, ruining their states while forcing people to move to more sane places that were actually following the science? I'm absolutely -- you know, I'm basically Florida's biggest realtor of the year, because I think it's a normal place where kids are going to school, they're gone to after school, they're playing sports, and it's somewhere that you know, feels like 2019 in a very sane way. CARLSON: You can see what's going to happen. So a small number of people destroy the states they run and then their allies in the Congress are going to force the rest of us to bail them out. Like that's coming, is it not? MARKOWICZ: Yes, absolutely. Oh, of course. You see that in every decision that they make. I mean, especially on schools, I think as we watch schools not return, you know, any day now, what they're waiting for is more funding, more funding, more funding. And as if that's going to solve some sort of problem for them. Yet, schools are open again, in places like, like Florida and Texas, and in many places all over the country and it is working. It's just in these deep blue areas that are really again, refusing to follow the science, refusing to actually take seriously what this virus is and how we can protect ourselves from it, that have managed to not, you know, not be able to move on from this at all. Even with the vaccines now they're incapable of moving forward. CARLSON: Yes, cynical people leading neurotic people right off the edge of a cliff. That's the story of the northeast. MARKOWICZ: Oh, yes. CARLSON: Sad. Karol, thank you. We're out of time tonight, but we will be back Monday and every weeknight at 8:00 p.m., the show that is the sworn enemy of lying pomposity, smugness and groupthink. Have the best weekend with the ones you love. We will see you soon. Here is Sean Hannity. Classification"
2021-02-19,"TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening, and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. Nothing changes the society long term more than the way we teach our children, what we teach them and how we teach them. If you want to pass on your values, you tell your kids about them. So school matters, may be more than anything, and from the very first day of this show, we have covered the way our schools are changing and the indoctrination that your kids are suffering through. Here was our first segment on it. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I taught my class shortly after Hillary Clinton gave her concession speech, and for many students, particularly for young women, it was something to -- a glass ceiling to break, to aspire to have a woman as President of the United States. And so I don't think it's about as you were saying, being hysterical. But it's about processing and having a space to make sense of what happened and to have a discussion. CARLSON: I get it, but it's also about having safe spaces and at the University of Michigan Law School where adults are presumably attending. And I'm quoting now, ""Post-election, self-care, and food and play."" So this included Play-Doh and Legos, a safe space for people to go to, you know, feel, I don't know what, and that is kind of the question to you. What is a safe space exactly? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well, in my opinion, the role of higher education is to foster debate, but also to be cognizant of students that are coming to our campuses from many different backgrounds. CARLSON: But the role of the university in practical terms is not to foster a debate, it's to squelch it. And so people who disagree are crushed, and people who agree with the herd are elevated. I mean, there's no -- is there really a debate, do you know a single DePaul University professor who voted for Trump and said so out loud. Do you know one? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You know what, I do not talk about my personal political leanings with my colleagues, and -- CARLSON: You know this as well as I do that there isn't any, at all. The whole idea of diversity is that the airless room produces bad decisions. We need people from different walks of life who have different points of view in order to make wise decisions. I think that's the underlying justification for it. And yet, in academia, there's virtually no one who disagrees from the liberal orthodoxy. CARLSON: Boy, that was only four years ago, and already, it seems an antique. People who disagree with each other talking through their disagreement, that doesn't happen anymore. And of course, the curricula at so many schools has taken a much harder edge since that time, from the extreme left-wing to the outright totalitarian. Now, we've spent the last several years telling you about what's happening at the level of higher education in colleges and universities. Tonight, we want to take you through what's happening in high schools and elementary schools all across the country. We're going to start tonight in Buffalo. Schools in Buffalo now have what they call an Office of Culturally and Linguistically Responsive Initiatives. The Buffalo School District's first days of school lesson plan explicitly gets political, in very specific terms, ""Do black lives matter in America,"" it begins. And then by the end, it declares, at the end of the lesson, quote, ""Students will be able to understand the need for the Black Lives Matter movement."" Here you have a school district explicitly endorsing a political movement, and that's for little kids. By the time they hit the fifth grade, students in Buffalo are reading advanced BLM Studies. Students learn about BLM's core platform and that includes, quote, ""Disrupting the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure,"" destroying the family that's endorsed by Buffalo schools. At the end of the program, students are asked this, quote, ""What do you think about our society being organized into separate nuclear family units?"" The implication, of course, is that it's immoral, your own family is immoral. And that's just the beginning. Buffalo Public Schools go on to suggest that George Washington, the man who founded this country was a fraud, that Colin Kaepernick is a moral hero, and that we should then celebrate Indigenous Peoples Day instead of Thanksgiving. We have no right to give thanks for a country that isn't ours. By the time they head to high school, students in Buffalo are ready to go out into the world to destroy buildings and statues. That's what they're being trained for. They're asked this explicitly, quote, ""Why would someone engaging in rioting be protected under the First Amendment?"" Okay. So this is everywhere by the way. We don't mean to single out Buffalo, it is happening in middle schools all over the country. They are celebrating something called Black Lives Matter Week of Action. Again, Black Lives Matter is a political party, and yet schools are endorsing it and its specific aims. Cities that are doing this include Seattle, Portland, Oregon, Los Angeles, the second largest city in the country, Chicago, the third largest; Milwaukee, Boston, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, Baltimore -- we could go on. The lesson plan requires children to, quote: ""Examine the ways the Black Panther Party successfully functioned to preserve the values of black families and villages,"" end quote. The Black Panther Party, racial separatists with a history of murdering people. But of course, that's done included. This is rewriting history, including recent history that all of us are very familiar with. They're lying about it already. Look at the image on the screen. This is from a third grade class in the Fairfield Susan Unified School District in California. The comparison suggests that police respond only to BLM riots. Of course, that's a lie. But kids are being taught that. They're being taught more broadly that the police are the problem. They're the ones who commit violence. Look at this drawing. It was posted on an online photo album about D.C. Public Schools' Black Lives Matter at School Week of Action. How young was the kid who was forced to draw a police officer shooting and killing someone? This is Cameroon Rouge propaganda. It's not education. But again, that's just the beginning. Schools have eliminated Biology. They're teaching children Biology isn't real. How can you teach something that is fake, so they're not. One of the guiding principles the Black Lives Matter at schools curriculum, of course, is to be quote, ""transgender affirming."" So they have no choice, out with Biology, in with BLM. Here's how one pre-kindergarten teacher in a New York Public school teaching, described this principle, quote: ""Everybody has the right to choose their own gender by listening to their own heart and mind. Everyone gets to choose if they are a boy or a girl or both, or neither or something else, and no one gets to choose for them."" So science isn't real. Again, this is being taught to children in schools, in lieu of actual science. This is religion. This is insanity. This is also required. Parents could fight back and in some rare cases they have. In November of 2019, for example, this show highlighted a teacher training program from Corwin called quote, ""Deep Equity."" The point of Deep Equity is to "" ... produce real school improvement for equity and social justice,"" end quote. In other words, not to teach children facts, but to brainwash them. According to Deep Equity, the point is to adopt a, quote, "" ... transformationalist white identity,"" where, quote, "" ... white folks are attempting to come to terms with race in a real way and question the systemic issues that have caused whites to be in a much superior position."" In schools, they are teaching this, race hate. Teachers are given white allies agenda items, quote, ""See race. Listen to and learn from people of color. Acknowledge the reality of racism, acknowledge the reality of white racial privilege. Transcend guilt, educate other white people. Confront racist behaviors, attitudes and practices. Use your privilege to work for racial and social justice,"" end quote. Again, we're going to look back at this and see it for what it was, race hate. But Deep Equity has been used all over the country, even in places that probably didn't want it. In zip codes that had voted overwhelmingly for the Republican President, Fauquier County, Virginia, for example voted for Donald Trump by 25 points in 2016. But of course, Deep Equity is part of that county's teacher training. Have parents done much? Apparently they haven't. They may not know what's happening. Deep Equity was also used in Chandler, Arizona. The program according to the school district there cost $418,156.00 to implement, almost half a million. But after we featured Deep Equity on this show, parents in Chandler stood up and objected to it, thank God, and Deep Equity was ended there. This is happening all over the country in school districts your kids may attend and you may not know about it. What can we do about it? What effect is it having on our children? On the society? Heather Mac Donald is a Fellow at the Manhattan Institute and the author of ""Diversity Delusion."" We're happy to have her on tonight to assess what we're seeing. Heather, thanks so much for coming on. HEATHER MAC DONALD, FELLOW, MANHATTAN INSTITUTE: Thank you. CARLSON: So this is being taught everywhere, almost nobody is saying anything about it. The passiveness of the population kind of defies belief. But I'm wondering what you think the long term effect of it is. MAC DONALD: It is civilizational crushing, spirit killing, and the long term effect is to try and get the elites in this country to discard any remaining shred of meritocracy. The first obligation of education, Tucker, is to be true. The Black Lives Matter narrative is based on lies. It is a lie that racism defines the shape of American society today. Far more complex factors than racism lie behind socioeconomic and racial disparities. Factors like family breakdown, culture, attitudes towards academic achievement and criminal involvement, far from being racist. Every American mainstream institution today gives preferences to blacks and Hispanics in hiring. So Americans should reject the Black Lives Matter narrative and they should sure reject it in education where it is going to divide this country further and destroy any possibility of further civilizational advance. CARLSON: It's baffling to me the last administration's Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice allowed this stuff to continue when it's so clearly an unvarnished, undisguised racial attack, singling people out by the race and attacking them. Hard to believe we're allowing that in this country. If your kids are in a school district like this, how do you respond to it? MAC DONALD: Well, there's a great asymmetry in our public discourse. The Black Lives Matter-Biden narrative is allowed to denigrate, I'm going to use the term and this is very hot button Tucker, but I'm going to use the term ""whites."" It is explicitly as you say, anti-white. And one is allowed to pile on whites. Biden's Inaugural Address spoke about the enduring growing racial inequities in this country, white supremacy. But you're not allowed to notice that and say that what is resulting from this is going to be a race war. What we need are philanthropists that have some vision, that have some courage to give parents a way out, not everybody can homeschool. We need a set of impregnable institutions that have made as their defining principle, the rejection of racial victimology, and the ability to teach students to be proud of their heritage because it is worthy of that pride. CARLSON: I've got to say, and I share your instincts, it is crazy, get out. But the public schools were designed in part to unite the country. It's a shared experience that every kid has and that's where we pass on our civic religion, love of country, our shared values. And so if normal people or people who have the means, get out, you really do have a permanently divided country. Isn't our goal, unity? I mean, that's what I want the goal to be anyway. MAC DONALD: Well, you've got to try persuasion, but if that doesn't work, you've got to use exit, but certainly -- and what is going to take again, the fundamental idea that is driving virtually all our politics today is that racism defines everything you see about American society. We need to be courageous and come up with alternative explanations that are difficult to articulate. But they must be said, because as long as bias remains the only allowable explanation for disparities, the left wins. CARLSON: Yes, I kind of like the Martin Luther King goal, which was colorblind meritocracy. How hard would it be to return to that? MAC DONALD: Very hard. You know, but of course, all of these elites do expect that their doctors are going to be chosen based on merit, that their engineers that build bridges are based on merit. But I can tell you, Tucker, that is a weak assumption. It is something you can no longer count on. Even the Trump administration allowed the poison of identity politics to go into its STEM funding. The Biden administration, it is going to be hellacious. One's imagination cannot possibly fathom how much single colorblind standards of merit and achievement are going to be shredded under the Biden administration. We have to speak back at this. CARLSON: I hope none of their kids get into Princeton anymore. I mean that. I hope, they all go to Community College. MAC DONALD: It's just as bad there. CARLSON: Because you're right. This is the ruling class protecting itself. There's no doubt. Heather Mac Donald, I appreciate your coming on tonight. Thank you. MAC DONALD: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: Now, the principal, the head of one public school is now calling for parents to quote, ""abolish people"" with the wrong DNA. This is insanity. And the country had better say so or dark days ahead, we'll tell you where it's being said. CARLSON: So much has changed in our schools from kindergarten all the way through college. Most people aren't aware of it because almost nobody says it out loud. You don't even have to attack what's happening in schools, you merely have to read the lesson plans out loud. The details are horrifying, and again, nobody ever does that. So tonight we're going to. Here's one example: Seattle. Public schools there have begun teaching Black Lives Matter lesson plans to students, a political party's platform being read as education to kids. Teachers are told that no matter their students' age, quote, ""They are not too young to talk about race."" According to the lesson plan in Seattle, quote, ""Silence about race reinforces racism,"" end quote, which is untrue. It's a lie. But that's the lesson plan. Educators are cautioned that quote, ""Treating everyone the same, maybe unintentionally oppressive."" Equality is racism. Meanwhile, in Philadelphia, an elementary school is forcing fifth grade students to celebrate ""black communism,"" quote, and simulate a black power rally in honor of political radical Angela Davis, a communist. Insanity. Jason Rantz is a radio show host in Seattle. He's been on top of the story for quite some time now. We're happy to have him on tonight. Jason, good to see you. Has anyone pushed back against what's happening in Seattle schools? JASON RANTZ, SEATTLE RADIO SHOW HOST: Yes, when parents figure out what's going on, they push back, the problem is, a lot of the parents didn't realize that this was going to be part of the lesson plan. I mean on paper when you're told that your kid is going to be learning about equality or equity, well, that would make sense to the average parent who doesn't realize that schools mean something different when they say equity and equality. They are talking about it in pretty fringe political terms, not what normal people would generally think of when we say equity. When schools say equity, they actually mean different outcomes. They don't actually mean equity. So, you know, there's coded language here that they're not really picking up on and when we have remote learning situations, and the parent is in the other room overhearing what their kid is being taught, all of a sudden, like, wait a minute, this is wrong, and they are speaking up. The problem is, oftentimes their complaints are falling on deaf ears. CARLSON: How many people in Seattle who were upset about the death of George Floyd over Memorial Day, realized that that event would mean their kids' education was abruptly ended and replaced with political propaganda? Do you think any of them knew that at the time? RANTZ: They probably didn't know that, but Seattle is also a pretty weird place. I mean, half of them probably are not upset with this. But what seems pretty clear is these kids are getting it both at the home, but also now in the classroom, in some cases, some of this propaganda. I mean, your opening monologue, I think, said it perfectly. When you're putting in front of kids, as early as kindergarten, a set of talking points to get them to believe something, it's much easier to develop and mold their minds into one particular perspective. When you're telling them as a kindergartner, that black lives are systematically and intentionally targeted for demise, which is part of the lesson plan, or that any incarceration of black people, any incarceration is, quote, ""an act of state violence,"" when you're giving them context free data points, like black Americans are killed at disproportionately higher rates than white Americans. They're not understanding the nuance of any of these points. You're not giving them the context of why that might be, disproportionality arguments tend to be incredibly lazy because you don't tell them why, you don't give them any of the data that can make a better argument. CARLSON: It's really radical. Jason Rantz, I appreciate your bringing this to light. Thank you. RANTZ: Thank you, Tucker. CARLSON: As we said, this stuff festers and it will change the way this country operates long term because no one ever exposes the details to sunlight. In some cases, they're too shocking; in others, they're too embarrassing. But in many cases, parents are just too afraid. So again, we're going to do it, we're going to give you another example. This is from New York City. The principal of East Side Community School in New York, the school teaches grades six through 12, has sent white parents something called a tool for action. The school tells them these parents must become, and we're quoting, ""white traitors,"" and then advocate for full white abolition. White abolition? What the hell does that mean? We're not sure. We know the tools for action call for quote, ""dismantling whiteness, and not allowing whiteness to reassert itself,"" end quote. Now, if you want to make people super paranoid and crazy, say things like this out loud to their children, especially since as far as we know, you can't change your skin color. So attacking people on the basis of it is always a dead end. It's always a recipe for disunion, and worse. So why are we allowing it? Christopher Rufo was the very first to report on this. He's a Director at the Discovery Institute. We're happy to have him on tonight. Chris, thanks a lot for joining us. It's hard to believe these are direct quotes. CHRISTOPHER RUFO, RESEARCH FELLOW, DISCOVERY INSTITUTE: Yes, it is. But Tucker, this all emerges from a theory called the pedagogy of the oppressed that is now been being taught in school districts around the country. It comes from 1960s and 1970s Brazilian Marxist named Paulo Freire, who said that we need to use the schools to develop critical consciousness among students, who will then grow up to have a revolutionary potential to overthrow a dictatorial and oppressive society. And when you look at these things in that context, they're using this very, a deeply divisive racialized language, not just for race itself, but to pursue this kind of radical Marxist political program that I think underlies all of these specific examples you're tackling today. CARLSON: Is it legal to single out parents or children on the basis of their skin color for attacks? I mean, haven't we spent the last 50 years saying that was a bad thing? How is this allowed? RUFO: We have, but as you talked about with Jason, it is this shift away from equality, which was colorblindness and equal protection under the law towards equity, which is active discrimination to rectify any racial disparities. I'm actually working with a coalition of lawyers and law firms to start filing lawsuits. We believe absolutely, that it's against -- a violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. But the fact is, is that this is all very new. It's emerged in the last few years. There isn't any case law. We're hoping eventually to get to the Supreme Court and establish once and for all that these Critical Race Theory based pedagogical programs are not only morally bankrupt, but actually direct violations of the Constitution and the Civil Rights Act. CARLSON: Of course they are. And I would say that no matter which race was being singled out, it's wrong. It's always wrong. This is universal principle, which we must defend. Very quickly, you're gathering, it sounds like a coalition of people to finally fight back since the Congress, the Republicans, the Congress is doing literally nothing to save the country. Do you meet in the course of talking to people about this, any liberals who say, yes, I'm on your side, not because I agree with you on a lot of things, but like, we've always been against this, we have to be against this -- do you ever meet any liberals like that? RUFO: I do. But really they are basically shamed and intimidated and bullied into silence. But I will share this, Tucker, there is one community that is successfully fighting back that has shut down these programs in schools. It's the Asian-American community on the West Coast. They're not afraid of being labeled white supremacists, which is absurd. They are deeply committed to academics and education and they are really the last defenders of meritocracy. They want their kids to learn and succeed. They escaped the Cultural Revolution in China, and they've come here for the American system, and they're now really the greatest defenders of it. And I think we can look to them for leadership and alliances in pushing back. CARLSON: Well, God bless them and they -- anybody with that point of view is welcome on the show any day, and I appreciate your coming on tonight. Chris Rufo, thank you. Well, administrators in one school district are changing the names of dozens of schools in order to fight systemic oppression. None are improving the schools, they are just changing the name. They explained their reasoning in writing. Maybe one of the most amusing unintentionally funniest documents we've seen all year. We will tell you about it, just ahead. KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Live from ""America's News Headquarters,"" I'm Kevin Corke. Southern cities slammed by winter storms this week now suffering from a severe water shortage. Record low temperatures and bursting pipes in Texas, Tennessee and Mississippi, a man died at an Abilene healthcare facility because medical treatments there couldn't be performed due to a lack of water pressure. This week's ice and snowstorms forcing rolling blackouts from Minnesota to Texas. Extreme weather is also being blamed for the death of at least 69 people. Major U.S. airlines will begin asking passengers for COVID-19 contact tracing details. The trade group, Airlines for America says the carriers will turn that information over to the C.D.C. International passengers will be asked for names, phone numbers, e-mail addresses and home addresses, but that will be strictly voluntary. I'm Kevin Corke in Washington. We take you back now to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. CARLSON: Oregon's Department of Education is encouraging teachers to register for training that is encouraging something called Ethno Mathematics. Ethno Mathematics. I am not making that up. That training teaches that white supremacy manifests itself in the focus on finding the right answer to math problems. Algebra is racist. French Revolution anyone? Libby Emmons is a Senior Editor at the ""Post Millennial."" She joins us tonight. Okay, this is one of those stories. It's hard to believe it's real. There are so many of those. How could math be racist, since it is purely objective? LIBBY EMMONS, SENIOR EDITOR, ""POST MILLENNIAL"": Well, that's a really good question, but to answer that question, you also have to understand that objectivity is now considered racist. So, you know, that's part of the problem. Anything where you get to have right and wrong answers, well, you know, that's racist. But there are several additional problems with this entire program. The first one is that this is the idea that teachers are perpetuating racism in the classroom, because they are racist. They are blind to their own biases and they don't have any control over whether or not they bring that racism with them. The other one is, as you said, this idea that math is a white discipline, which even a modicum of research would tell you is monumentally absurd. And the third is this concept of the soft bigotry of lowered expectations that tells people that students of color can't achieve to the given standard. And so those standards need to be changed. But the problem of course, is that kids aren't stupid and they know when they're being pandered to, they know when they're being patted on the head and told that they're doing a good job when they know themselves that they're not measuring up. We also know that kids thrive when they are held to account. Any parent can tell you this. When a child is expected to live up to a certain measure of responsibility, kids are able to thrive with that. They need that, they need to be able to take care of themselves and to live up to standards. CARLSON: Yes. EMMONS: Yes, any kid knows this. And so when we treat them like they're idiots that they need to have interpretive dance lessons in order to learn math, they see right through that. They obviously do. So I don't know who is being fooled here. We're bankrupting our nation. We're bankrupting these kids' lives. The schools are closed. We're killing them that way. And we're also messing so much with the language where we're accepting the terms of leftist indoctrination. We're accepting these terms, anti-racism, there's no reason for us to do this. They're not real. They're not based in reality. And we're also -- CARLSON: No, you're right, and we're pretending that this is on the level when it's not. EMMONS: Yes. CARLSON: Well, you've obviously -- you've obviously picked up on that. Libby, I appreciate you coming on again tonight. EMMONS: No, they are not. CARLSON: It is good to see you. Thank you. EMMONS: Thanks so much. CARLSON: Well, for the better part of a year now, public schools in San Francisco have refused to educate children. They've kept classrooms closed. But that doesn't mean they aren't doing anything. They're very busy. They just voted to rename 44 schools because the names were racist. Now, how are these names racist? Many of the names are people who weren't racist, in fact, were strongly against racism like most Americans are. So why did they do it? Well, the School Board made the mistake of putting their reasoning for each name change in a spreadsheet, you should take a look at the spreadsheet. It's incredible how stupid these people are, the ones in charge of the schools. Here's one example. Abe Lincoln's name was scrubbed from a high school because of, quote, ""Rampant corruption in the Indian office in his administration."" Again, this is the guy who ended slavery, our 16th President, who signed the Emancipation Proclamation. He's gone. Corruption in the Indian office. Now, they wanted to scrub Dianne Feinstein's name from an elementary school. Dianne Feinstein? Why was her name on a school anyway? She's a mediocre senator. But they're taking it off now. She's not woke enough. If Dianne Feinstein is not woke enough for you, what's your school district like? Lisa Boothe knows the answer to that. She is a Senior Fellow at the Independent Women's Voice. She joins us now. Lisa Boothe. LISA BOOTHE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Hi, Tucker. CARLSON: This stuff never ends. I don't know why I am laughing. BOOTHE: I know. I know. CARLSON: It is a tragedy in motion. But rather than improve the schools, they've spent the year, as the kids languished -- were destroyed in some cases, they change the names. On what basis did they change these names? BOOTHE: Well, because of course, they're all racist. As you mentioned that huge racist, Abraham Lincoln. But what's hilarious here is the research behind it is actually riddled in inaccuracies because they didn't consult historians. They looked at things like Wikipedia and TV shows as the basis of some of their decision making and information. And what it really speaks to, Tucker, is this level of mediocrity, not just in our public schools, but society as a whole, that these kinds of decisions, these kinds of discussions, they don't have to be rooted in fact, particularly when they're being done in the name of wokeness, in the name of virtue signaling. But as you pointed out, what is sad in all of this is the children lose, the students lose because you look at San Francisco, 70 percent of white students are proficient in Math compared to just 12 percent of black students. That's an astounding 58-point gap. So rather than looking at ways to try to narrow that gap, to actually help minority students to advance their lives, to make their lives better, this is the kind of woke garbage that has the attention of the School Board. CARLSON: I mean, where are parents in all of this? You hate to think that, you know, there's passive as they seem, but if this was your kid's school, would you sit back and let them denounce Abraham Lincoln as a racist when you say something? BOOTHE: No, I would be outraged. But I also think people that watch this show and know me, know that I'm incredibly opinionated. So no, I would be out there sounding the alarm, you know, making it known that I'm unhappy and getting other parents behind me. And look, it's one of those things that -- it would be easy to write this off and say, you know what, people of San Francisco, you voted for this. These are the people that you chose. But the problem is, this sort of woke totalitarianism -- or totalitarianism has infected all aspects of our society. These leftists are in control of every lever of power in this country. They want compliance and they're in the position of power. It's not only forced compliance to punish those who dissent and also disagree. But I think all of this particularly when you look at the fact that we spend about $15,000.00 on average per child in America, parents should absolutely have the right to take those tax dollars elsewhere, to have school choice instead of to be beholden to this kind of woke garbage from teachers unions and School Boards. CARLSON: I think that's totally fair. These people never build anything, they only destroy what others have made. That's the theme. BOOTHE: Absolutely. CARLSON: Lisa Boothe, it is great to see you tonight. Thank you. BOOTHE: Thanks, Tucker. As always, thank you. CARLSON: So the center of all these stories are the kids who are in these schools. And a few weeks ago we got an e-mail from one frustrated sophomore and what he was facing in schools, a political indoctrination. We'll read it for you, next. CARLSON: We've got it a pretty revealing e-mail recently from a kid called Elliott Morse. It was a copy of something he sent to his teachers the day of a last week's riot at the Capitol. Elliott Morse is 16 years old, he is a sophomore at Duxbury High School in Massachusetts. We want to read to you some of what he wrote. ""Dear Mr. Donovan and Mr. Cucinatto, as the world was shocked by the violence and unprecedented events that occurred on January 6, 2021, these events should be condemned and it should be a wake-up call as to our country to unify and bind together. As I sit on Zoom listening to each teacher speak about these issues, I feel more and more isolated from our community at Duxbury High School."" ""As someone with a view that may not be popular in today's day and age, I feel as though there could be a more effective and better way to talk of going about talking about what happened yesterday in a way that makes people like me feel more welcome."" ""The First Amendment gives me as well as every American the right to freedom of speech. Everyone is entitled to say what they believe. It is inappropriate for teachers to impose their views on their students."" ""I have now sat through four different classes and in three out of four, have spoken about the issue of what happened yesterday. The negativity toward our 45th President and the events, even those people that are Americans like you and me made me realize just how divided our country is."" ""Being on opposite sides of the spectrum, it never crossed my mind until I went into A.P. Government to speak about the election and the protest. This topic is very tough to speak about and has many different sides. That being said, neither side is right, and neither side should take all the blame."" ""The one thing I do know for sure is that we are weaker, divided."" ""Teachers seem to lead toward condemning conservatives and praising Democrats in all different fields and for that reason, I feel isolated from our community and enraged that my opinion is viewed as wrong by some students and by some teachers."" ""I am writing this e-mail so my fellow classmates can live in harmony and so that I do not raise my children in a society that is this divided. I wish that all opinions could be heard to their full extent whether people agree or disagree. It doesn't matter what race, religion, sexuality and/or political belief you come from, a school should be a safe haven for everyone to feel welcome."" ""As of right now, I feel others' beliefs are being imposed on me. I'm the eldest of four boys and my brothers look up to me to set the example."" ""I was doing homework with my youngest brother who at the time was in first grade. I noticed a drawing in his folder. I pulled out this drawing and I was heartbroken. My brother had drawn a picture of President Trump and written, 'Trump should not build the wall.' My seven-year-old brother knows nothing about politics. He knows nothing about the real world. He was being manipulated to belief something he should never even have known about."" ""As a seven-year-old, he should have been focused on when the next time he can play outside or read books, not about politics. Sincerely, Elliott Mores."" We've told you for years about the lies that college students have to accept and repeat in order to graduate, but things have changed dramatically. We're going to tell you what kindergarteners are, quote, ""learning in class."" Pure indoctrination. One mother has an unbelievable story straight ahead. Plus, Google hasn't simply infiltrated the classroom, it is tracking your students outside of school. That's next. CARLSON: Well if you've been anywhere near a college campus lately or know anyone who cheered the renaming of the Washington Redskins, you probably heard the term ""land acknowledgement."" But if you haven't heard the term, here's what it is. Land acknowledgement means you're acknowledging guilt for living on land that was taken from some other group at some point in the past, maybe thousands of years before. In other words, land acknowledgement is a way to feel guilty about living virtually anywhere on Planet Earth. At an inauguration event for Joe Biden, for example, one Democrat offered this land acknowledgement, quote, ""Our country was built on indigenous land and we paid tribute to the indigenous nations,"" end quote. Now the purpose -- and we should be very clear about this -- of land acknowledgment isn't to solve anything or make anyone's life better. None of the people who perform land acknowledgments give up their own land, return it to anyone. They don't really believe what they're saying. If they did, of course, once again, they will give up their own land. That's not the point. The point is control. In order to make people obedient to your will, first they must feel inferior. Many school districts are now doing everything they can to make your kids feel that way. Inferior, flawed. Here's the latest example. One mother in Renton, Washington recorded her child's kindergarten teacher forcing the class to participate in a land acknowledgement every day. The sessions, the struggle sessions went on endlessly. One went on for 17 minutes, all for the benefit of the Duwamish Tribe who didn't in the end of course benefit, they got nothing. The mother recorded the classes and confronted the principal about it. As the mother put it, quote, ""You just told my kids that they are living on something stolen and stealing is bad. I was in shock."" Of course, the mother probably didn't steal her land, she probably pays her mortgage for it. But that's what they told her kid. And that shouldn't surprise you. When you lock children inside for an entire year at home as so many school districts have, you've already taught them they are inferior, they're flawed. They're not worth educating. That's the message. In Renton, Washington, they are just making that message explicit. It's entirely possible that your child's school has entered without your knowledge into an arrangement with the company, Google, in order to place its products -- Google products -- into your child's classroom. So what does that mean for your child? Well, we know in part because the State of New Mexico sued Google over this. Ultimately, the suit was dismissed. But New Mexico alleged with some evidence that Google invaded children's privacy by providing tools to State schools and then using those tools to track students and their activities on their personal electronic devices when they weren't in school. Google knew what their kids were doing, even when they weren't in the classroom and all of that happened without parental consent. It is an amazing story. Rachel Bovard has been on it. She's from the Internet Accountability Project. She joins us now. Rachel, thanks so much for coming on. Tell us -- and we say this before so many stories. It's amazing this is real, but apparently it is. How does this work? RACHEL BOVARD, INTERNET ACCOUNTABILITY PROJECT: So basically, what happens is the way Google markets all of its products, right, they're offered either for free, or for very low price. And so Google has infiltrated our American schools in just this way, with Chromebooks with Google EdTech and services. So schools are now Google's client, which really means your child is Google's client. And so what they do is they log these kids into Chromebooks and what happens is the Chrome browser then syncs all the activity that is taking place either on that Chromebook or on the child's home computer that they may have logged into their school account with. Now, according to the details of this New Mexico case, they are alleging Google tracks everything from your child's web search history to what they watch on YouTube, to their voice recording and location, among many other details. Now, Federal law actually requires parental consent for the tracking and storage of this data. Parents are supposed to be able to opt out of this. But an initial judge in New Mexico at the District Court level said, well, hey, schools can consent on behalf of the parents. So this is a very troubling development for parents because their child is now a client of Google, a profile is being created. Now Google says they don't use this for ad revenue, but Google has made those claims before and they haven't quite panned out. CARLSON: Yes, I mean, I wouldn't just say a client of Google, I would say a victim of Google. Your child is being exploited by the most powerful company in the world for profit, and there's literally nothing you can do. Can parents opt out of having their kids use Google products in school? BOVARD: Well, you would think, but then they'll be shut off from how schools really educate these children now. Google has made itself essential to how we educate in public schools. And I think what's worse is that, you know, in many cases, Google uses teachers in these schools to advertise to other teachers. So they aren't having to advertise, they are using teachers to do it in some sort of warped multilevel marketing scheme. But again, Google is not a trustworthy actor here. I mean, they've been fined multiple times for the misuse of children's data. As recently as 2019, they were fined $170 million for misusing the data of children collected from YouTube. So again, Google is not a trustworthy actor here and there's not much unfortunately parents can do unless they take it up directly with their School District. CARLSON: Is any other company allowed a monopoly in schools to use your children for profit without your permission? Is Philip Morris selling Marlboros to your kids? Is Anheuser-Busch giving them free Bud Light to hook them on the product? I mean, why is Google allowed to do this? BOVARD: Because Google markets itself as, you know, a safe product, it's a safe addiction, Tucker. Our laws aren't quite prepared to deal with what Google is and what Google is doing. But again, it goes back to this issue too, of scale, because Google is so dominant, they can get in at the ground level, they can out compete everyone else on price, because they are so dominant. And so you know, you're seeing schools transition away from other EdTech, away from, you know, potentially better tech for privacy and moving to Google, because again, Google makes it so attractive for them. CARLSON: I think you'd honestly be better off giving your kids tins of Copenhagen for free. I think it's less dangerous and less harmful than these products. I mean that, too. Rachel Bovard, I appreciate your shining a light on this. It's shocking. BOVARD: Thank you. CARLSON: Well, we're out of time, and out of days in the week. We'll be back Monday night, 8:00 p.m. and every weeknight. The show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. Have a wonderful weekend with the ones you love. We'll see you Monday. Classification"
2021-01-12,"TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. It's been a very tough week in the United States of America. A spasm of mob violence followed by an unprecedented crackdown on our basic civil liberties. This is the darkest time many Americans can remember. But even in the midst of this disaster, there have been flashes of comedy and we're grateful for every one of them. We got one today. It was a statement from a group called the Global Public Policy Team at Twitter. I mean, you may have thought Twitter was just a social media company run by some bearded ethereal pothead in downtown San Francisco, but not anymore. While you were sleeping Twitter got bigger than you ever imagined it could. Twitter is now an independent nation state with its own National Security Council, an interagency constellation of foreign policy experts whose job it is to manage the world's affairs. So Twitter's Global Public Policy Team is really the company's own N.S.C. So the Global Public Policy people weighed in today as Security Councils do on the upcoming elections in Uganda and here's what they said about those elections, quote, ""Ahead of the Ugandan election, we're hearing reports that Internet service providers are being ordered to block social media and messaging apps. We strongly condemn internet shutdowns. They are hugely harmful, violate basic human rights and the principles of the #OpenInternet."" ""Access to information and freedom of expression including the public conversation on Twitter is never more important than during the democratic processes particularly elections."" End quote. So marinate on that a bit, just let it sink in. Twitter is reminding the Ugandan people that censorship is immoral. Sorry, Ugandans, you're not allowed to silence other people's Twitter accounts especially in the run up to an election. You just can't do that now. We recognize you don't have a Bill of Rights or a centuries-old tradition of self-government out there in Uganda, so you might not have known this as we do here. But to restate, censoring voters' social media accounts is hugely harmful. Online censorship violates, quote ""basic human rights."" In fact, it's an attack on democracy itself. Got that, Ugandans? Now we understand you're a primitive developing nation, so we'll give you a pass this time, but don't forget it. Censorship bad. #OpenInternet. It's almost too good. In fact, we checked to see if it was real. It is. Twitter actually sent that, which only proves that the tech monopolies are even worse than we thought they were, not only are they cruelly authoritarian and totally dishonest, as well as limitlessly ambitious, but they are also -- and we didn't know this -- childishly stupid. They have no idea how they appear to others. They can't see themselves. They lack even a glimmer of the ironic self-awareness that is a prerequisite for wisdom. They are idiots. They don't even get their own jokes. On the other hand, none of this is really very funny. It's terrifying. We don't need to convince you of that. You have seen the crackdown and the censorship all week long, and you sense all of it is going to get worse and you're right about that, it is going to get worse. So tonight, for once, we are going to forego the long open and we're going to let others talk about what we're seeing right now. You're about to hear from two people: one from the left, one from the right, but united in their belief that the Freedom of Speech is the foundation of all that we have in this country, without the absolute right to say what you believe, you are not a citizen, you are not even fully human. You are a serf. Glenn Greenwald is a lifelong man of the left. He did not vote for Donald Trump. He opposed in fact many of Donald Trump's policies; but above all, Glenn Greenwald is a defender of the principles of the enlightenment and he is unyielding in that, totally unyielding. So unyielding he was recently driven from his employer and he now writes independently on ""Substack"" where we hope you will support him. Then we will speak to a lifelong man of the right, someone whose biography and views and indeed whose face you know well. Glenn Beck joins us in a moment. But first tonight to Glenn Greenwald. Glenn, thanks so much for joining us. We really appreciate it. So this statement from Twitter encapsulated so much of what is happening and what is yet to come that I have to ask you about it to begin. Here you have a tech company acting as if it possesses its own State Department, giving totally unself-aware instructions about Internet freedom to foreign countries across the Atlantic Ocean. What can we infer from this statement? GLENN GREENWALD, JOURNALIST: Well, I do think that the tweet that to which that alludes and that you were alluding to in your opening is an event that we need to pause and think about because to me it was one of the most alarming events to take place in American politics in the last decade, which is that in the weeks up to the 2020 election, Twitter and Facebook united to ban any discussion of reporting by the nation's oldest newspaper, ""The New York Post"" about documents regarding the Biden family, the frontrunner for the President of the United States that everyone acknowledges were completely authentic. They simply censored any ability to disseminate discussion or reporting about the leading presidential candidate whom they wanted to win. In other words, doing exactly that which they are now lecturing the Ugandans that you can't do without violating the spirit of the open internet and attacking democracy itself. They are right about the principles that they expressed in that tweet, the irony though, the really sick dark and dangerous irony is that they themselves are leading the way not just Twitter, but Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple in doing exactly that which they are lecturing other countries that they can't do. And I think the broader point, the more important one, Tucker, is that these countries are acting like nation states, more powerful than nation states because that's what they are. Facebook, too, has committees now the way a government would have committees, studying what is true and what is false, what kind of speech is dangerous, what kind of speech isn't dangerous and that's why the amazing thing is that in the wake of Twitter and Facebook's ban of President Trump, you had numerous democracies around the world who have no love loss for Donald Trump quite the contrary: Chancellor Angela Merkel in Germany, the President of Mexico, French Ministers who came out and said this is extremely dangerous that Silicon Valley is anointing itself the world media that controls and is more powerful than other democracies because they know that's coming for their democracies as well. CARLSON: So you did some reporting today and yesterday and what happened to the social media app, Parler, which was expelled really from the internet shutdown by Amazon Web Services, biggest server farms in the world on the pretext that they somehow contributed to the violence that we saw last week at the U.S. Capitol. Tell us what you learned about Parler's role in that riot on Wednesday. GREENWALD: So of the first 13 people arrested by the F.B.I. in connection with the event at the Capitol, a total of zero were active users of Parler. The overwhelming amount of planning for that event, the overwhelming amount of advocacy for people to go there and to breach the Capitol was done on Facebook and on YouTube and on Twitter. And this is one of the ironies is that Google was one of the monopolies that wants to police our discourse and control our thinking and rule our politics that kicked Parler off of its app at exactly the time that Parler had gone to number one, the most downloaded app in the country, millions of Americans wanting to use it. Google said we will not allow you on our service because you have the role that you played in stimulating violence and extremism at the Capitol and elsewhere and the reality is the service that Google owns, YouTube, played a much greater role in organizing and advocating for that event at the Capitol. If google was really interested in disassociating itself from violence and extremism, they wouldn't disassociate themselves from Parler, but from YouTube. And you had Democratic politicians like AOC and others demanding that Google and Apple kick Parler off using their power as officials in the party that's about to assume control over the government and then they then obeyed, but why weren't these Democratic officials demanding that Google and Apple kick Facebook and YouTube off of their platform since they played a much bigger role because they donate and pour huge amounts of money into the Democratic Party and their allies and that's what is so menacing here, not just the censorship from Silicon Valley, but the partnership they're in with the party that's about to take over the Congress and the White House. CARLSON: Glenn Greenwald, a principled man and always a source of the clearest big picture. Appreciate you coming on. Thank you. GREENWALD: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: So Glenn Beck has thought a lot about this. Glenn Beck owns his own media company. He is the host of ""The Glenn Beck Radio Program,"" founder of ""The Blaze,"" he joins us tonight. Glenn, I really appreciate your coming on. As noted, you own a media company so you're coming on and talking about the tech companies at some risk to yourself. I assume you use Amazon Web Services, everybody else does, I have. So from your perspective, what's the risk here from these companies? GLENN BECK, FOUNDER, ""THE BLAZE"": This is the reason why I built ""The Blaze"" in the first place is because I saw this coming. Between the political upheaval and quite honestly, the technological upheaval that is coming, that is going to displace so many people, the government and high tech need each other. So this, with the implosion of trust, they have to join hands and it's extraordinarily dangerous, it's the kind of stuff quite honestly that leads to this. These are two wooden shoes -- Japanese shoes -- worn by an American citizen. Her name was Rio Sotto, she lived in San Francisco. She lost all of her rights as did all of the Japanese and they did it because of fear. FDR was afraid the Japanese had infiltrated the West Coast even though The Pentagon said it wasn't true. He knew better and so he pushed through his policies and we made one of the -- one of the biggest mistakes of the 20th Century by taking our own citizens, and listen to this, confiscating their wealth, making sure they couldn't work, shutting them down and then putting them in camps. Tucker, this is the road we are on again, and it's not right if it's the left or the right that is doing it. It is absolutely un-American. You can't have Freedom of Speech if you can't have -- if you can't express yourself in a meaningful place. This is -- this is like the Germans with the Jews behind the wall. They would put them in the ghetto. Well, this is the digital ghetto. You can talk all you want. Jews, you do whatever you want behind the wall. Well, that's not meaningful and that's where we are, that's where millions of Americans will be. And again it's not to compare it to the Germans, it is not to uh do anything but warn if you don't stand up for free speech, you will be the one that loses it as well. After 9/11, I stood up proudly against many in my audience for Bill Maher when he said, well at least their pilots aren't cowards. I thought that was a horrific thing to say. But when ABC fired him, I couldn't -- I couldn't understand what part of politically incorrect didn't you understand, ABC. CARLSON: That's right. BECK: We cannot, we have to -- the only speech worth defending is the speech you despise. Everything else, nobody has a problem with, they are not trying to ban it. CARLSON: I grew up in a pretty liberal place and what you just said was an almost daily feature of what liberals said. BECK: Yes. CARLSON: That's what we heard every day. You know, protect the weakest. The rights of the weakest are a measure of how free you are. I don't hear a single liberal saying that. BECK: No, because the liberals aren't liberals anymore and that's the problem. We need good classic liberals, people who believe in the Bill of Rights. I don't care who you vote for, what you do, how you live, who you have sex with. Do you believe in the Bill of Rights? Do you believe in those things? If you do, that's our unum. That's what we can unite on. Right now, people are asking us to unite. On what? On exactly what you believe? That's not coming together. Let me also give you something else here. Let me just quote this, ""The Corporation cannot curtail the liberty of press and religion of these people consistent with the purposes of the Constitution guarantees and certainly the corporation can no more deprive people of Freedom of Press and Religion than it can discriminate against commerce. Ownership does not always mean absolute dominion. The owners of privately held bridges, ferries, turnpikes and railroads may not operate them as freely as a farmer does on his own farm."" That's the Supreme Court of the United States in 1946 Marsh versus Alabama. The Corporation cannot curtail -- I am a free market person. I believe in the free market and the freedom of corporations. CARLSON: Yes. BECK: But not to take away people's rights, their basic rights. CARLSON: Exactly. That's exactly -- and you just hit on the irony at the center of libertarianism. If you support a system that eliminates people's rights, you're not standing for freedom. In fact, you're standing for tyranny, and I have never heard it as nicely put as you just put it. BECK: Yes. CARLSON: Glenn Greenwald, thank you. BECK: Thank you, Tucker. Thank you. I'm a huge fan. I think you're doing great. CARLSON: Glenn Beck. Sorry, we had two Glenns. Glenn Beck, the Great Glenn Beck, I appreciate it. BECK: Thank you. CARLSON: So you're seeing Democrats in the house have sex with Chinese spies, others take money from China state-owned businesses. Now, one of the most prominent Democrats in the United States taking her relationship with the government of China to the very next level. You'll know her name, for sure. You won't believe what she is doing now. CARLSON: Well, masculinity, if we're being honest is something of a sensitive topic over at the Cable News Network. Of course, they know toxic masculinity is bad, along with the patriarchy, everybody knows that. But how about regular masculinity? Assuming that still exists. Well, you might be surprised to know masculinity is extremely important to CNN's corporate culture as it would be if you're five, five and lifts. Take Chris Cuomo's set for example, they don't have coffee on that set. They have instead protein powder and energy bars and lots of pictures of Chris Cuomo exercising slowly until the veins pop. That's how serious they take manhood over at CNN. But as you can imagine, there's a downside. All of that testosterone in one place is like a powder keg and last night unintentionally, a Trump spokesman called Hogan Gidley lit that fuse and he did so by claiming that Donald Trump is the most masculine President in the history of the United States, more masculine than George Washington or Teddy Roosevelt. Well, Mr. Don Lemon of CNN's prime time lineup wasn't having it. Here is how he responded. DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR: He is the President of the United States. He is the most masculine -- come on, man. Shut -- shut up. Shut up. He is the biggest snowflake of them all. I don't want to hear about your feelings. Give me facts and not feelings. Why are you coddling his feelings all the time? Why are you coddling all of these people's feelings? We need to understand how they feel. Oh they feel, they need to accept -- give him time to accept the election. Really? Who is the snowflake now? The president's legacy will be not the most masculine President, but the biggest loser we have ever had as President. CARLSON: Ooh. Guess who's going to miss Donald Trump quite a bit -- CNN. But in the meantime we're concerned, this is all getting out of hand, a little bit, all that masculinity, all that gender-neutral masculinity, things could get out of hand. So in the spirit of easing tensions and lowering the temperature at CNN, we have no problem admitting for the record that Mr. Don Lemon is one heaping helping hunk of a man. We're not ashamed to say that, at all. We have no problem admitting that. No problem whatsoever. Apologies to Chris Cuomo. In the past four months, we've learned a lot about the Democratic Party's relationship with the Chinese government. We know at least one member of the House Intelligence Committee had sexual intercourse with a Chinese spy. We know that others have taken money from companies tied to the Communist Party of China. Now we're learning something even more amazing. Barbara Boxer, the long-time Democratic Senator from California, she retired in 2017, has registered as a foreign agent under FARA for a company called Hikvision U.S.A. Now that's the American subsidiary of a Chinese surveillance company that has been blacklisted by the United States government. Well this evening, under scrutiny, Barbara Boxer deregistered under FARA as a foreign agent for Hikvision. It doesn't mean she's not lobbying for them, we're not sure what it means. The whole thing is pretty amazing so I thought we'd ask Gordon Chang who follows this stuff. He is a Senior Fellow at the Gatestone Institute, author of ""The Great U.S.-China Tech War"" and he joins us with reaction to this. Gordon Chang, thanks for coming on. So it's not that I'm surprised that Barbara Boxer would do this, I'm shocked that in this environment, she thought she could get away with it. What does it tell you that one of the most famous former senators in America registered as a foreign agent for a Chinese surveillance company that have been blacklisted? GORDON CHANG, SENIOR FELLOW, GATESTONE INSTITUTE: It tells me that the Chinese Communist Party has completely infiltrated the U.S. political system especially the Democratic Party in California, because you not only have Barbara Boxer, you've got Dianne Feinstein with China problems, and then of course the person you referred to, Eric Swalwell who has yet to adequately explain his relationship with a suspected Ministry of State security agent. You know, we've got a problem here because it's not only the Democrats, it's also David Vitter, the former Republican Senator from Louisiana. He is also working for Hikvision and this means we need to get China out of our political system. We need to cut our ties with the regime. Yes, that's drastic, but we know that they are exploiting the openness of our political system to overthrow our government. CARLSON: I mean at a certain point -- look, you know, people do all kinds of things I wouldn't do to make a living. It's tough to make a living, I try not to judge. But working for the government of China or a Chinese surveillance company is so obviously unpatriotic and immoral for an American to do that you would think at some point, someone will say, you know, maybe forgo the paycheck, maybe don't work for the Chinese surveillance company. Is our political culture so corrupted that occurs to no one? CHANG: Yes, and the thing is that Hikvision is not just a Chinese company involved in surveillance. This company is complicit in crimes against humanity, the worst the world has seen since 1941 when Germany started mass exterminations. So really, what we're talking about is not just a Chinese company, it is one which is the worst of the worst. CARLSON: I've got to ask you, just in in 30 seconds, Jack Ma, one of the richest people in the world obviously ran Alibaba, one of the biggest -- top 10 biggest companies in the world seems to have disappeared. Where is he, do you know? CHANG: We don't know. I think that the Communist Party is holding him. There was a Communist Party publication, which said that he was quote- unquote ""embracing supervision."" There are all sorts of rumors swarming around Alibaba and ANT Group, his other company. Some people are talking about expropriation in whole or in part. This is just a warning to all of us of what China can do in the business community. CARLSON: You think it'll be the lead on CNBC every night, where is Jack Ma? I mean, if our government kidnapped Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan, I hope we'd cover it. No one even mentions this. It's like -- it's very, very telling. Gordon Chang, it's great to see you. Thank you. CHANG: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: Well, we have a kind of a surprising admission from one top Democrat leading one of our biggest states. It turns out he is a science denier. He basically admitted that. We'll tell you why, after the break. CARLSON: Well, it's hard to find in this country a bigger supporter of lockdowns than the Emmy award-winning Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo. In April, to name one among a thousand examples, Governor Cuomo mocked anyone who questioned lockdowns as science deniers. ""What's worse than death?"" Cuomo asked. In other words, stay in your tiny apartment. Watch Netflix and rot. Don't see your friends or family. Don't go to school. Don't go to work, not that your job exists anymore. Stay alone. By the way, we've got some weed for you so you won't remember it. In order to protect life, we need to destroy lives. That was Andrew Cuomo's philosophy all year long. GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): A bar or a restaurant that is violating these rules can lose their liquor license. If you are a nonessential worker, you shouldn't be leaving your home. I want local governments to enforce the social distancing rules. So we're going to increase the potential maximum fine from $500.00 to $1,000.00. When I issued the stay-at-home order, it wasn't it would be nice if you did. It is a mandate. You should be happy because if we don't change the trajectory, we're going to go to shutdown and then your business is going to close. CARLSON: Okay, just to make sure we have it clear. Rapists, you're fine. Head down to the subway. Good luck. Anyone who violates Andrew Cuomo's arbitrary lockdown orders will face the full power of the state. He said that for months. But then this week, in a plot twist that nobody saw coming in the enormous scripted drama that is American politics, Andrew Cuomo changed on a dime to the other direction. He did win an Emmy after all. Here's what Andrew Cuomo wrote in a tweet today, yes, we follow him, quote: ""We simply cannot stay closed until the vaccine hits critical mass. The cost is too high. We'll have nothing left to open. We must reopen the economy, but we must do it smartly and safely."" Well, if that sounds strangely familiar, it may be because two months ago, the much reviled and often criticized Governor of the State of Florida, the free State of Florida, Ron DeSantis said exactly the same thing, but Ron DeSantis is a Republican presiding over one of the few free states left in the country, so CNN and Twitter instantly told us that was irresponsible and dangerous. Censor him immediately. Anything to prevent you from realizing how little they know and how badly New York is doing compared to the rest of the country. But now we do know. And that's why millions of New Yorkers having realized that their state is a disaster are moving. They are moving out of New York in unprecedented numbers. Francis Suarez is the Mayor of Miami, still a great city. He says, he would like to lure large tech companies to Florida and has been. He joins us tonight to explain. Mr. Mayor, thanks so much for coming on. Congratulations on your city, which remains sane and open, safe and decent. It's a great city. I have to wonder though about your plan to lure the worst people in America to the State of Florida. I'm serious. I mean, they wrecked California. Why would you want them in Florida? MAYOR FRANCIS SUAREZ (R), MIAMI, FLORIDA: Well, let me tell you. We left Cuba because, you know the Cuban government basically nationalized property and took away our ability to be productive. And so what's happening in a lot of these cities across America is people who are the creative class, the innovators those who create jobs are fleeing cities that are taxing them to death, that don't appreciate them and their innovation and what they've done to create jobs in their local economy and so what I'm noticing is those people who I'm talking to and I'm talking to them day in and day out having lunches with them and cafecito tech talks. They are telling me how awful the government is where they are fleeing from and, so, I don't think they want to reproduce that in Miami because certainly that's not what we're looking for here. CARLSON: Right, well, it is certainly not what any decent person will be looking for, but you have to assess their track record. They've been in control of Northern California for an entire generation. They literally control the state, of course, they are the biggest companies in the world. They've made it so unlivable that they themselves are fleeing, so why don't you worry they would do the same thing to your state? SUAREZ: Well, I can tell you I think that they've learned their lesson and they realize that the formula does not work, you know, taxing people to death, having cities that have a tremendous amount of homelessness, a high crime that is not a formula for success. In the City of Miami, we have very few homeless. We are down and crime by 24 percent last year. The year before, we had the lowest homicide rate since 1954; second lowest tax rate since the 1960s. So that formula of a free market enterprise and capitalism that we learned the hard way, unfortunately, through being expelled from our country in Cuba and so many immigrants here, Venezuelans and Nicaraguans, we've learned that those command economies don't work. They are not going to work in the United States. They're not going to work anywhere in the history of humanity. CARLSON: So that's what exactly -- and I agree with everything you said except the last part. I mean, that's exactly why having seen the horrors of badly run government, you wouldn't want Fidel Castro's lieutenants moving to Miami, right? So why shouldn't the kids from Google and Facebook have to spend like the next decade in Secaucus, New Jersey being deprogrammed? Why should they get -- I'm serious -- they are fleeing to your state because there are no state income taxes and they're greedy, and you know that. So why shouldn't they have to spend some time being deprogrammed? Sincere question. SUAREZ: Well, I think that they have been deprogrammed, which is why they are leaving. At least in the conversations that I have, they are certainly no fans of the governments that they are leaving from, and that is probably the major complaint that they, you know that they -- that they give. And so for me, you know, what we want to do is create an economy where the intellectual class and the creative class and the innovative class have the ability in a free market system to be able to create high-paying jobs that my children -- I have a six-year-old and a two-and-a-half-year-old can enjoy in the future, because that is the future of our economy whether we like it or not. It's going to be based on the ability to innovate and make -- you know, private sector companies and governments more efficient over time. CARLSON: I mean, I know you want the right things because I know how well your city is doing and I know you're part of that and I want to congratulate you again. I just -- Florida is one of the last free places left in the country and I just -- you can imagine how worried the rest of the country is about it being destroyed. Good luck, Mayor Suarez. I appreciate you coming on. SUAREZ: Thank you. CARLSON: Thank you. SUAREZ: I appreciate it. CARLSON: So how much can you expect to receive in coronavirus relief from the government this year? According to coronavirus bill that's already been signed into law that will depend on your skin color: how you were born. What? Isn't that totally immoral? Isn't that why Jim Crow was wrong? Aren't we against that? No, we're for it. No one is talking about this. We will, after the break. CARLSON: On Friday, in a little noticed announcement, Joe Biden explained his plan for distributing the emergency coronavirus relief. And for many people, this is an emergency and they need relief. But that's not how Joe Biden is thinking about this. Biden explained he would like to allocate the money, these are Federal tax dollars, based on the skin color of the business owner. Watch this. JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: I want to be very clear what my priorities are for distributing this emergency aid swiftly and equitably. Our focus will be on small businesses on Main Street that aren't wealthy and well-connected, that are facing real economic hardships through no fault of their own. Our priority will be Black, Latino, Asian, and Native American owned small businesses, women-owned businesses. CARLSON: So that is race-based discrimination, that's the simplest explanation of what you've just heard. That is a textbook example of it. It's illegal. It's immoral. It's everything that this country should be ashamed of having done in the past. And yet, out in public, in front of the microphone, the President-elect is announcing his plan to do it again. In fact it's occurring already. This show can exclusively report that the Federal Coronavirus Relief Bill that's already been signed into law -- how did that happen -- specifically calls for airport authorities to give out millions of tax dollars in rent relief grants based on the race of the business owner. Again, money is collected from all American citizens because they are American citizens, but then doled out according to the race of American citizens. That's poison. And this is a direct quote from the bill, now the law: ""Airport sponsors shall prioritize relief from rent and minimum annual guarantee to minority owned businesses."" States across the country have programs like this already in place. Just last summer, for example, Oregon established a fund exclusively for quote, ""black people, black-owned businesses, and black community based organizations."" The country is in turmoil. The economy is heading off a cliff -- everybody knows that. And in the middle of this national emergency, the sadness, this tragedy, one political party has decided to add racial division to our long list of problems. Ed Blum has marched all of this happen. He is one of the few who has tried to fight against it. He is a legal strategist. He runs the Project on Fair Representation, which is involved in a lawsuit against the State of Oregon for exactly what you just heard. Ed, I appreciate your coming on tonight how -- EDWARD BLUM, LEGAL STRATEGIST: Thanks for having me. CARLSON: How under anyone's understanding of Federal Civil Rights law is this allowed? How is it legal? BLUM: Well, Tucker, it's not. You articulated it well. It's unconstitutional, it's unfair and it's unnecessary. If the State of Oregon wants to help small businesses that have been adversely impacted by COVID- 19, that's fine. But what they basically did was hang out a sign that said ""No Hispanics. No Asian-Americans. No whites and no Native Americans need apply."" This is pure racial demagoguery. It is racial exclusion and it violates the foundation of our Civil Rights laws. CARLSON: So, Republicans have been too cowardly by and large even to mention that this is happening. They signed off on some of this legislation. Mitch McConnell has bigger problems apparently. Nobody is defending the most basic American idea which is color blind meritocracy. You are judged for who you are and what you do, not for how you look and who your parents were. Why is no one defending that? BLUM: Tucker, bringing Federal lawsuits in court such as the one we did in Oregon is a costly, difficult, time-consuming thing to do. The people, the three business owners that are challenging this Oregon program; one is a self-described Mexican-American woman who owns a coffee shop; two of them are small white businessmen. It is a difficult thing to do to go into Federal Court, put your name out there. You are going to be demonized. You are going to be ostracized. But thank goodness, there are still brave men and women who are willing to go into court and to fight this. CARLSON: Ostracized for defending the only course possible to us, which is judging people for who they are and not how they look? You're ostracized for doing that? It is just -- it is pure insanity and someone needs to get some courage and tell the truth, but I'm glad that you are and I'm sad that it has fallen to you, but God bless you for trying. Ed Blum, thanks. BLUM: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: So, it looks like the President in his final week in office may be impeached a second time. Things are moving very quickly. We will have an update with Brit Hume when we come back. CARLSON: Earlier tonight, we gave you a window into the masculinity-crazed workplace culture at CNN, empire of the Dwarf King. But Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo are just the tip of the spear, so to speak, a very long spear. In fact, the culture of masculinity runs so deep at CNN and CNN's Digital Operation is also awash in the dreaded chemical, testosterone. Just like the guys on TV, the digital team at CNN was enraged that someone had claimed Donald Trump was the most masculine President of all time. So they brought their lattes over to keyboards and started pounding. After the chaos settled, CNN's digital team published an article with this actual headline quote: ""A brief list of more masculine presidents than Donald Trump."" And somehow, that's not even the best part. The piece goes on to name George Washington, Ulysses S. Grant, Teddy Roosevelt, William McKinley as sexier -- sorry -- more masculine than Donald Trump. In other words, CNN has endorsed every ex-President that Antifa has ever called a racist bigot. That's how committed they are to masculinity. They are more masculine, it turns out than they are woke and that is saying something, but we support that. This is all a bit weird, by the way, but it gets weirder. The piece concludes this way: Trump's idea of masculinity is deeply flawed. So to sum up for you, CNN is now defining, deigning to define what masculinity is -- just so you know. So in case you've got questions about your own manhood, go to CNN. They will tell you what it means to be a man. They are like dad to you. Well, today, the third Republican in the House of Representatives, Liz Cheney of Wyoming said that she would gladly vote to impeach the President in his final week in office. FOX News is reporting Mitch McConnell things impeachment will help the Republican Party get rid of Donald Trump and the stain he has left on the party. Now, this is not, whatever else it is, an orderly and peaceful transition of power, impeaching a man in his final week in office. So what's the point of this? Is there? Well, there has got to be and Brit Hume would know. He is a FOX News senior political analyst and he joins us tonight with an explanation. Brit, great to see you. BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Thank you. CARLSON: So there has got to be a reason. It doesn't make obvious sense, and of course, it's not orderly and peaceful. So why are they doing this, do you think? HUME: Well, one is Trump is obviously this point radioactive, not just among liberals and Democrats where he has always been absolutely loathed. But now, to a great extent among everyday Republicans. CARLSON: Right. HUME: I don't think they doubt he retains his hardest of hard-core base. They will be with him forever, I'm sure. But in the rest of the Republican Party, they are looking at this and they are saying, what we don't want is this guy hanging around in two or four years -- two years in the congressional elections and worst of all, running for President again after that because he will pull off a segment of the Republican vote, make it unavailable to ordinary Republicans, regular Republicans and be a curse on them. So, you know, that's hard truth of a political calculation they are making, and the other thing is they are furious with him. They believe in their bones that he cost them the two special elections in the State of Georgia, which they manifested should not have lost. Both candidates were ahead and didn't quite get enough to avoid a runoff and then they lost in the runoff. A lot of Republicans stayed home, offended by Trump. That's the reasoning anyway. So that's the reason Republicans are turning away from him. They think he is bad news politically. CARLSON: I certainly understand why they are mad at him. A lot of people who voted for him are mad at him, for sure, but impeaching him is a separate question. If you want to make certain that a lot of your voters think that you're reading off of someone else's script, if you want to make Trump last even longer in the minds of the public, you would impeach him, wouldn't you? I mean, wouldn't it be better to just ignore him? HUME: Those are the competing political calculations, Tucker. I mean, I don't really think that it is -- I think it would be pretty hard to revive his fortunes politically at this time even by being, you know, what a lot of people would consider to be unfair, after all, let's do keep in mind that the overriding purpose of the whole impeachment power written into the Constitution is to get rid, get out of office an offending President who has done something truly, truly reprehensible. Somebody said the other day on Twitter that they, you know, had this way or that way of doing things. I said, I've have got a plan. Get rid of him in 12 days. This was a few days ago. CARLSON: Right. HUME: He is gone. He is finished. And you know, he was down at the border today, but he is almost invisible now. You know, he is being chastised and you know, he is a dead duck politically. So the purpose of it, I think is a bit overkill at this stage. Now, you can make an argument that he committed an impeachable offense. But all of that stuff he said for weeks on end after the election that he won it in a landslide and that was all stolen from him and that Mike Pence had the authority, which he most certainly did not, of reversing the results at the last minute last week, I mean, that was utter balderdash and he fed it into the veins of his supporters and one could make a pretty good case that that's part of what got them into a fever that led to last week's events. CARLSON: Right. You've just got to wonder if it's not just better to make the case against -- to make the case against -- no one ever wants to make the case, they just want to vote for impeachment. Brit Hume, it is great to see you tonight. I appreciate your perspective on that. HUME: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: Thank you very much. HUME: You bet. CARLSON: Well, another big day in the life of the country, every day is at this point. We are going to be happy to be back tomorrow night, 8:00 p.m., the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink. We will do our best to bring all of this news with that perspective, with maximum cheerfulness because why not? Our time here is limited no matter what we do, so there's no reason to be grim all the time. We're going to really try our best not to be. But in the meantime, we have great news for you. We are turning this over to our friend in New York, Sean Hannity takes over at nine. Classification"
2021-02-09,"TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. You've probably been glued to the tube all day, Donald Trump's second impeachment proceedings started. We didn't watch any of it. We did hear from a number of people that Trump's head lawyer didn't do a very good job. On a slow day that might be a mildly interesting fact. But at this point, honestly, who cares? Impeachment? The whole thing is ridiculous. They are literally impeaching a President who isn't even the President anymore. They're yelling at someone who's already left the room. It's a farce, insulting and absurd. Anyone who tells you the details of today's Potemkin impeachment are important is probably trying to distract you from something that actually is important. There are a lot of those things right now, more than ever. One of them is our ongoing COVID pandemic, after months of hearing that life could never return to normal until we get a vaccine, we got a vaccine -- two vaccines actually, but life did not return to normal. Life got worse. We were instructed to take the new vaccine as soon as possible, and then to put on more masks. One mask was no longer enough. Anyone who complained about that was punished. Most people obeyed the orders, they had no choice. But the whole thing made them nervous. How could it not? Why exactly did the rules change all of a sudden, they wondered? Was there a good reason for that? When are we finally going to repeal corona law? And what about this vaccine? Why are Americans being discouraged from asking simple, straightforward questions about it? Questions like how effective are these drugs? Are they safe? What's the miscarriage risk for pregnant women, for example? Is there a study on that? May we see it? And by the way, how much are the drug companies making off this stuff? Well, there's nothing QAnon about questions like that, they're not conspiracy theories. They're the most basic questions. In a democracy, every citizen has a right to know the answer. But instead, we got fluff and propaganda. The media rollout for the vaccine came off like a Diet Pepsi commercial at the Super Bowl, tons of celebrity endorsements, not a lot of science. It was totally disingenuous, and naturally, it had the opposite of the intended effect. Most Americans already supported vaccines. They didn't need to be browbeaten in order to be convinced, they were grateful their kids no longer get tetanus and polio and chickenpox. They weren't anti-vaxxers. And yet, from the very first day, the way the authorities handled the COVID vaccine did not inspire confidence. If the vaccine was so great, why were all these people lying about it? Honest question, and they were lying. Clearly, they were lying. You know that for certain because from the moment the COVID vaccine arrived, the most powerful people in America worked to make certain that no one could criticize it. Here's Bill Gates' wife on CNN back in December. POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: Do the social media companies -- Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, on and on -- have a responsibility to do more right now, Melinda in terms of getting this misinformation, this disinformation off their platforms? MELINDA GATES, COFOUNDER, BILL AND MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION: They absolutely have a responsibility. The internet and the rise of social media has happened so quickly, that really the regulations and the good policymaking hasn't stayed out in front of it, and quite frankly, it needs to catch up. CARLSON: Quite frankly, she says, we need to censor people's views on the COVID vaccine. Now, remember, Melinda Gates is not a scientist. She did not develop this vaccine. She has no background in epidemiology or any relevant discipline. She worked in the marketing department at Microsoft. But she is the wife of a billionaire. That's why she is on television. It's why she is allowed to control what you're allowed to say about the drug she is demanding you inject in your body. Is this really science? Not even close. It's oligarchy. And all the billionaires are participating in it. The tech companies announced early they would not allow anyone to criticize this vaccine and anyone who did would be kicked off their platforms right away. And then corporate media took it upon themselves to enforce this rule. Just yesterday, CNN ran a story with this headline, quote, ""Facebook vowed to crackdown on COVID-19 vaccine misinformation, but misleading posts remain easy to find."" That's not a news story. That's an open call for censorship, and it worked. CNN identified a group on Facebook called COVID-19 Vaccine Injury Stories and the group was exactly what it sounds like, people talking about their experiences with the vaccine. Last week, that group was in the top 20 groups on all of Facebook. Today, after the CNN piece came out, we searched for that group, we couldn't find it. Even when we search specifically for its name, effectively COVID-19 Vaccine Injury stories no longer exists. CNN shut them down, erased them. Instead search for the word vaccine on Facebook and you will find a lot of material -- exclusive material -- that matches precisely the storyline approved by Melinda Gates and her fellow non-scientist billionaires. And the line is clear, you've heard it a million times, the COVID vaccine is morally good. Period. Don't dare say anything else. So if your neighbor drops dead after getting the shot, keep it to yourself. Facts like that are not allowed on Facebook nor on Twitter. They've got the same policy. Quote, ""I posted that there were multiple reports of adverse reactions to the vaccine,"" wrote one Twitter user, "" ... and that the vaccines were still not fully trialed on pregnant women and kids. Twitter banned me until I deleted it for false information."" Is it false information? That's irrelevant. According to another user, quote, ""Twitter suspended me for saying that vaccines have known side effects,"" end quote, which of course they do. Physicians who develop vaccines concede that, but at the moment, you are not allowed to say it. Facebook has long led the way in this kind of censorship. Last year, the company prohibited users from buying any advertisement that might discourage people from taking the vaccine or that might portray the new vaccines as quote, ""unsafe or ineffective."" Now in the months since, tens of millions of Americans have been vaccinated and most of them seem fine. On the other hand, scientists are now conceding on the record, that the vaccine may trigger a fatal blood disorder in a small number of people. ""The New York Times"" wrote about it the other day. It's one of those stories you should save as a period piece for when the current darkness finally lifts, and we can think and speak clearly again. Two of the people at ""The New York Times"" interviewed wouldn't even give their names. One said she had been badly injured by the drug, but she feared she would be punished if she criticized the vaccine in public. In the picture ""The New York Times"" ran, she covered her face like she was a fugitive. Science can't live in an environment like this without relentless skepticism, science dies. That's what science is -- relentless skepticism, and when it leaves, inevitably, it's replaced by witchcraft and superstition. Are we there yet? You decide. The liberal website, VOX recently ran a piece complaining that Facebook users were still being allowed to, quote, ""Make fun of COVID-19 vaccination,"" and this offended them. Mockery is always the gravest threat to false religions. VOX demanded that Facebook remove the offending content immediately. As an example, VOX highlighted this image which they noted with alarm had already been shared more than 100,000 times on Facebook, and this infuriated them. Damn those smirking Americans. Make them stop laughing. And in a way, it is amusing. Even with total blanket censorship, it is pretty hard to crush the average person's sense of humor. But you've got to wonder, if they can force you to stop laughing about vaccines, what can't they make you do? Glenn Greenwald is a truly independent journalist whose work appears on ""Substack"" and that we hope you'll support, he joins us tonight. Glenn, thanks for coming on. I don't think you have to have a position on vaccines -- for whatever it is worth, I'm for them -- to think that it's very troubling news organizations or the government or billionaires or anybody would try and censor open conversation about their effects. GLENN GREENWALD, JOURNALIST: Well, we've obviously talked a lot, Tucker, about the practice of censoring for political opinion, declaring things hate speech or offensive and the dangers of censoring for that. I actually think this -- this pretense that they're able, this conceit that they are able to decree right and wrong, truth and falsity to the point where they can ban things that they declared to be false is even more pernicious than opinion-based censorship. The irony -- think about this -- if this Facebook policy had existed back in March less than a year ago, that says that if you dissent from the consensus of the World Health Organization and scientific experts, you will be banned from their platform. That would have meant that if you were somebody who in March went onto Facebook and said, I believe that you should wear masks, I believe that masks are effective against respiratory diseases of the kind that SARS and COVID-19 represent, you would have been banned because the science back then said that you shouldn't wear masks. Dr. Fauci was saying don't wear masks, they were saying not only are mask unnecessary, they could actually be dangerous. That's the whole point of science. Everything they do, these liberal guardians of orthodoxy and piety is about trying to make you think that they have a monopoly on objective truth by calling it science. Science is a human study which means it's fallible and exactly as you said, it is extremely dangerous to say that any kind of human knowledge is so unchallengeable to being discussed that it's off limits from even being questioned. CARLSON: I'm worried that maybe paradoxically, their demand that you believe what they say will result in millions of Americans not believing what anybody says. This will have an effect on people's faith in knowable truth. It'll have an effect on their mental health, it will make people crazy. That's my concern. GREENWALD: Well, no, and I think that's valid. You know, I agree -- I have the same view as you do, which is, when the vaccine is available where I live, I'm going to get it. My family is going to take it as well. Because the reason I'm convinced not that it's clearly true, but probably the best course for me and my family is because I informed myself. I use the free and open Internet to look at what experts were saying. I sought out dissenting opinion. And I was convinced that the consensus was probably right, that taking the vaccine was the best thing to do. But if the internet were a place where no dissent were allowed, I would have way less confidence in that ability because that would mean this is a profession that isn't confident enough to allow dissent, and if they're not confident enough to allow dissent, I think that they earn much less trust and faith in their pronouncements. CARLSON: Yes, I think it's a really wise observation. So I have to ask you, and I'm not sure the answer myself, why are they doing it? If it has the opposite of the intended effect, and that seems like it makes sense that it would, why are they continuing to do this, do you think? GREENWALD: I think it's so important to recognize that Silicon Valley companies are not the ones who want to do this. They are they -- they would rather stay as far away from censoring and arbitrating and intervening and kicking people off their platforms, not because they're noble and nice, but because it's in their business self-interest not to do it. They're being pressured to do it, Tucker. This is what's so amazing by CNN, and NBC and ""New York Times"" who are saying, every time you allow information over your platform that we think is wrong, we're going to shame you, we're going to disgrace you. And they have their partners who are the Democratic Party who control the entire government now who are right along with them saying, we demand that you censor more. They are being pressured, led by journalists, who are now the leading activists to destroy free discourse and free thought in the United States. That's the dynamic that we have to understand. CARLSON: I think you're exactly right. I don't think we can say that enough. Glenn Greenwald, thank you for that wise assessment. Appreciate it. GREENWALD: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: So last week, we told you, we reported on this show that Bank of America which used to be a bank has become instead of kind of Intelligence Agency, combing through its customers private financial records and turning them over to Federal investigators without the knowledge of their customers, doing it in secret. We caught them. We've got an update on that story. That's next. CARLSON: Los Angeles is the second largest city in the United States so what happens there matters. And right now, the City of Los Angeles is teetering on the edge of collapse and many are dying. Why? Because of bad decisions by its leaders, destructive decisions. South Los Angeles so 59 shooting victims for example in the first two weeks of this year. Last year, at the same time before the city defunded the police, there were seven murders. That's a massive increase. Dead people because of bad decisions. Meanwhile, the new District Attorney of Los Angeles, George Gascon has refused to enforce laws including against violent crime. That may shock you, it doesn't shock George Soros who paid for his campaign. That's what he wanted. But tonight, a Judge has stepped into all of this, FOX LA's Bill Melugin has more on that story for us tonight. Hey, Bill. BILL MELUGIN, REPORTER, FOX LOS ANGELES: Hey, Tucker, good evening to you. That's exactly right. Our new progressive District Attorney here in LA George Gascon suffered a pretty major setback in court yesterday. That's when a Judge ruled that some of his new progressive reforms are not only illegal, they are also unethical. So if we can pull up some video right now, I'll explain starting with his policy on California's three strikes law. California's three strikes law was voted in overwhelmingly by California voters back in the 1990s and the strikes law essentially allows prosecutors to seek harsher sentences for repeat criminal offenders. And on day one in office, George Gascon issued a directive to all of his prosecutors saying we are not going to enforce the three strikes law because it's my opinion that it is racist and it is unconstitutional. He then started forcing his prosecutors to read a statement in court, essentially agreeing with his legal opinion, and the Prosecutor Union had a big problem with that, so they sued him. They essentially sued their own boss. And yesterday a Judge ruled against George Gascon and sided with the Union's writing in part quote, from James Chalfant, the Judge, ""The District Attorney's disregard of the three strikes law plead and prove requirement is unlawful as is requiring Deputy DAs to seek dismissal of pending sentencing enhancements without a lawful basis. The special directive statement that prosecutors are required to read in court is legally inaccurate and incomplete, and reading this statement in court without correction is unethical."" So a big loss for Gascon on that. The Judge went on to issue an order restricting George Gascon from not following the three strikes law. He says just because it's your opinion that you don't want to enforce it doesn't mean you can't not enforce it so Gascon must now start enforcing it. I talked to the Vice President of the DA Union out here, they said they were relieved by this ruling from the Judge. They feel vindicated. And they say George Gascon's directives were causing a big problem for them. Take a listen. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is it kind of put us in this impossible position, do we follow his directives or do we follow the law? And the court clearly said, well, you need to follow the law. MELUGIN: And George Gascon released a statement yesterday in response to all of this saying he knew he was going to have a tough job trying to change what he says is an outdated racist system here in Los Angeles of mass incarceration. He says he plans to appeal this decision to a higher court -- Tucker. CARLSON: Bill, thanks for that report. One of the great reporters in the state that badly needs more of them. Well, last week, we told you that one of the largest and oldest banks in the country, Bank of America founded by A. P. Giannini is no longer really a bank, it is now kind of an Intelligence Agency spying on its customers without telling them, turning information over to the Feds. We obtained proof that Bank of America scanned through its customers' private financial records back in January and turned the information over to Federal investigators, once again, without telling its customers. The bank was looking for people who did among other things, rented hotel rooms in Washington in January, people who made purchases in January in Washington, D.C., and people who bought plane tickets. What's the point of this? Well, Bank of America when we asked them said they wouldn't comment on communications with law enforcement -- that was not reassuring -- and told us the bank has quote, ""Responsibilities under Federal law to comply with police inquiries."" That's not technically true. In fact, what they did may be illegal. But here's the interesting part. Since our story aired last week, Bank of America has not provided any further explanation for the spying we know they did on their own customers for political reasons. And as far as we know, despite the fact this is a big story, no politician in either party has bothered to ask Bank of America. So it is okay that one of America's largest financial institutions is now spying on people. And by the way, Bank of America may not be the only one. They're the only one we've caught so far. Should you be concerned about any of this? Victor Davis Hanson is a fellow at the Hoover Institution. He has thought about this subject fairly deeply and joins us tonight. Professor, thanks a lot for coming on. Should we be worried about this? VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION: Thank you. CARLSON: That Bank of America is spying on its customers? HANSON: Yes, because it suggests that the quietude might reflect that there are other people doing it more than we were aware of. And it's sort of also disturbing because we always thought that the corporation, the financial institution was wary of the left, and that wanted to be bipartisan in its consumer base. But when it starts to help an investigation of a particular ideological or perceived ideology, then it's kind of scary. Remember, Tim Cook at Apple during the 2015 San Bernardino shooting, the deceased shooter who killed 14 Americans, radical Islamic terrorist, the F.B.I. went to court to ask Apple to unlock his data on his iPhone for the investigations, and they refused. They said, we can't do that because we have to reassure our consumer base that their iPhone data is sacrosanct. And so this is -- it's not consistent. That's what's also worrisome. Do they pick some groups to spy on or surveil or turn over their private data, knock groups, we need it -- we need to know that. And I think people -- it's kind of scary Tucker, because in this huge octopus that we're facing now of Silicon Valley, traditional media, social media, professional sports, entertainment, Hollywood, we always thought the corporation and the financial institution was wary of surveillance or the left because it was afraid of, you know, the impairment of free market capitalism. But when you start to have the corporate boardroom or the financial institution giving the impression that it might have an ideological basis for some of its investigations, that's pretty scary and it shows you that wokeness is -- if that's the right term -- is everywhere now. CARLSON: I mean this -- HANSON: In every institution of power and influence in American society. CARLSON: This investigation is transparently political, of course, they didn't conduct anything like this when Antifa and Black Lives Matter burned a dozen cities this summer, nothing like this. HANSON: Yes. CARLSON: If Apple were participating in this kind of surveillance, of course, you would have no privacy at all. That would be truly horrifying and truly invasive. Why are no politicians demanding that Tim Cook explain whether or not Apple is cooperating with the Department of Justice to spy on Americans? HANSON: I don't know that answer, but I think the politicians of both parties because these five or six companies -- Google, Apple, Twitter, Facebook -- they have about $6 trillion in market capitalization. We've never seen such money aggregated in a 50-mile radius, and they've used it quite promiscuously. Remember, Mark Zuckerberg, $350 million. So it's not just that they're going to give the one politician or one candidate, they have the means to alter an election by getting out the vote or giving money to government officials in a particular precinct. I think people are having an ad campaign or spending -- helping to spend $100 million in Georgia. I think people are frightened of them, and they also maybe -- to give Tim Cook the benefit of the doubt, he is on record that Apple would never do that because he resisted the demands of his own government that was investigating a mass murder and a radical Islamist ideology. And would he be what -- tough on the F.B.I. that was investigating mass murder and not so tough on people who, you know, went into the Capitol, although there were five people killed, so I don't know the answer. But I'm very worried because I think that the average citizen looks around at this panopticon and every -- get -- use Facebook, do Twitter, turn on the NBA, you know, look at your investments. Look at your bank, and it's all now coalesced. Remember this ""Time"" Magazine's recent issue, the history of the shadow campaign where they boasted about the power of this collusionary effort. It's really -- I think people have got to wake up. It's dangerous. CARLSON: It is dangerous. Victor Davis Hanson, I appreciate it. Thank you. HANSON: Thank you. CARLSON: The one member the United States Senate, by the way, who might be pressing the Big Tech companies on these questions and the banks is Josh Hawley of Missouri. Nobody has been attacked more aggressively in the last six weeks than Josh Hawley. Is it possible they tried to take Josh Holley offline because they knew he is the one guy to ask those questions? I don't know. This is the moment of no questions though to add to the list of no questions, the World Health Organization is demanding that you stop asking questions about China. We're going to keep doing it though. Questions like: why does Joe Biden's pick to lead the C.I.A. have close ties with the Communist Party of China? That might be worth asking. That's next. CARLSON: A man called William Burns is Joe Biden's nominee to lead the C.I.A., and we're now learning just like the Biden family itself that Burns has ties to China and its communist government. The nominee to run the C.I.A. FOX's Trace Gallagher has details in that story tonight. Hey, Trace. TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Tucker, William Burns is a former Deputy Secretary of State and U.S. Ambassador to Russia. In 2014, he left government to lead the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a very influential U.S. think tank that has close ties to China. In fact, one of Carnegie's global centers is based in Beijing. And during his time as President of Carnegie, William burns brought in Chinese businessman Zhang Yi Chen to join the Board of Trustees. Zhang is a wealthy Chinese investor and member of two organizations linked to the Chinese Communist Party. According to ""The Daily Caller"" News Foundation, between July of 2017 and the end of 2020, Zhang donated between $750,000.00 to $1.5 million to Carnegie. The think tank says the donations do not support research projects in the U.S., but some say it's not the money, it is the influence because while Burns was at Carnegie, it also received donations from the China United States Exchange Foundation or CUSEF, which is a Hong Kong based think tank. But a global research firm led by former Intel officials from the U.S. says that CUSEF's lobbying activities in the U.S. quoting here, "" ... allows it to play a valuable role in Beijing's efforts to sway public opinion and build influence in America."" And all of this is why Republicans have repeatedly questioned whether Joe Biden will confront China for its human rights abuses and unfair trade practices, or allow China to keep cheating - - Tucker. CARLSON: Unbelievable. Trace Gallagher. Thanks so much. GALLAGHER: Yes. CARLSON: Again, we're not talking about the nominee to run the Department of the Interior, we're talking about the C.I.A. Director, ties to China. Insanity. But not the only insane thing going on. The World Health Organization for a long time has been useful, mostly for repeating exactly what the government of China would like it to say. When this pandemic began last year, for example, you'll remember that China told us the virus could not spread person to person. Doctors in Wuhan doubted that, but not the World Health Organization. They were busy praising the government of China on Twitter. Now, the World Health Organization wants you to know that the coronavirus had absolutely nothing, not one thing to do with that government virology lab in Wuhan, so shut up. PETER BEN EMBAREK, FOOD SAFETY SCIENTIST WITH W.H.O. AND THE INTERNATIONAL MISSION LEAD: The findings suggest that the laboratory incident hypothesis is extremely unlikely to explain the introduction of the virus into the human population. CARLSON: Yes, it's extremely unlikely. So we're just going to shut that investigation down. But the W.H.O., like China, itself, is now saying that really the virus may have come from frozen food shipments from other countries. Armenia seemed fine with this. Last night, in fact, Tom Friedman, probably the most famous columnist at ""The New York Times"" suggested that China is a much better country than this, and we should learn from them. THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, COLUMNIST, ""THE NEW YORK TIMES"": What are they doing in China today? You know, Chris, do you know that it takes four hours and 18 minutes to take the bullet train from Beijing to Shanghai, and it takes 21 hours to take the train from New York to Chicago, and both about the same distance. I can't -- I'll tell you something they weren't thinking about in China this week. They weren't thinking about some knucklehead. They weren't spending the week thinking about a knucklehead who claimed 9/11 didn't happen. They weren't thinking about some guy who is a QAnon Shaman. I don't know. They were probably thinking about some bad stuff, with the Uighurs and all of that. Oh, for sure. But I guarantee you, they weren't wasting their time on this nonsense. And how do we do this week after week, month after month, and think we are a serious country. We are so deeply unserious as a country right now. CARLSON: Yes, he's right. There are some deeply unserious people in this country, particularly on the op-ed page of ""The New York Times"" people who worry about some bad stuff with the Uighurs like genocide, whatever. They have fast trains. Miranda Devine is a columnist with ""The New York Post,"" a much more serious person. She joins us tonight to connect some dots and assess what we're watching. Miranda, I appreciate your coming on tonight. So the W.H.O. says stop asking questions about where the virus came from. It probably came from frozen food from like India. And no one in our media pauses and says, wait a second, is that true? Why does no one pause and ask that? MIRANDA DEVINE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: Thanks, Tucker. It's just this sort of Kafkaesque situation where we know that the World Health Organization is in bed with China, it's already made this pandemic much worse than it needed to be because it was lying for China, as you said back in January about human to human transmission. It's now orchestrated this completely fraudulent investigation in Wuhan into the source of the virus with a handpicked team of investigators and the American representative on that team is a man called Peter Daszak who is so deeply conflicted. There wouldn't be anyone else in America as conflicted unless you talked about Anthony Fauci who funded a lot of his research. Peter Daszak was actually working with the Wuhan Institute of Virology on that very dangerous Gain of Function Research into bat coronavirus as he funded it, and he also co-authored papers with them. So to have someone like him who has been so vociferously denying the idea that it could possibly have leaked from the lab is just putting, you know, the fox in charge of the henhouse. And of course, it's so predictable that they've come out now, they've been there a month, they've spent three hours in the Wuhan lab, and they have declared that the lab is not the culprit. Well, why are we surprised? And of course, the reason for all of this is to whitewash China's role, and that's suitable for everybody. That just makes us in America able to become friends with China again, which is of course, what Tom Friedman and, you know, all of Joe Biden's appointees to national security roles, they all want that. They just want to normalize what China has been doing and forget about the Uighurs, that's just some pesky little detail if you have a concentration camp where you're organizing gang rape of your own citizens, who cares? CARLSON: I think you make a smart point. China is acting in its own interest in whatever amoral diabolical way. It is people in the West who are betting it that we should be offended by. I think that's -- I think you're absolutely right. Miranda Devine, I appreciate it. Thank you. DEVINE: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: So just the other day, Joe Biden invalidated Federal enforcement of immigration laws in this country. We've got the memos that prove that. The former Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, I.C.E. walks us through those documents next. CARLSON: Joe Biden tried to end all deportation of illegal aliens from this country. That moratorium has been blocked by a Federal Judge. Today, the Judge extended the injunction through the end of this month. But despite the Judge's order, the Biden administration has still managed to end virtually all enforcement of Federal immigration law. Last night, we shared with you the details, internal memos from I.C.E. The documents say authorities should not attempt to arrest most criminals. The only exceptions are terrorists, migrants who crossed the border after November 1st and illegal aliens who have been convicted of felonies like murder. But the White House has made it clear that most other felony, serious felonies are not our problem. For example, the White House has quote ""postponed to play an I.C.E. operation to target sex offenders,"" sex offenders. They're telling us that drunk driving isn't really a problem either. PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: There's a new reporting that I.C.E. is going to get some new guidance to no longer focus on deporting illegal immigrants who have been convicted of DUI, simple assault, solicitation, drug-based crimes, among other things, and I'm curious how that is in the interest of public safety? JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Priority for the enforcement of immigration laws will be on those who are posing a national security threat, of course, a public safety threat, and on recent arrivals. Nobody is saying that DUIs or assaults are acceptable behavior and those arrested for such activity should be tried and sentenced as appropriate by a local law enforcement. But we're talking about the prioritization of who is going to be deported from the country. CARLSON: Oh, and you thought DUI was a big deal, you believed MAD when they told you that, you're a fool, apparently. The show has also confirmed that I.C.E. officers are now required to obtain approval from the head of the agency, whenever they want to make an arrest in the field. We are told that most of those requests have been denied. That's the point, of course. Jonathan Fahey is the former Director of I.C.E. He joins us tonight to tell us what exactly is going on. Mr. Fahey, thanks so much for coming on. I mean, what do you make of this? It must be shocking to you. JONATHAN FAHEY, FORMER DIRECTOR OF I.C.E.: Thank you for having me, Tucker. First of all, it is alarming, but it certainly is not shocking or surprising. If anyone watched the campaign or have watched the Democratic sanctuary cities over the last few years, this shouldn't be the least bit surprising. But it's still alarming, and it's still putting our public safety at risk because essentially, I.C.E. has been told not to deport criminals anymore. We've gone to another level on this immigration debate. It used to be if people were here working hard, not committing crimes, the argument was, they should be allowed to stay. Now, the argument has evolved into even when they're here committing crimes, committing aggravated felonies, they should be allowed to stay and enjoy every right, privilege or benefit that American citizens enjoy. It's truly remarkable. One of the things that's most amazing about this is they do not even want to deport gang members without proof of gang membership. But they consider gang tattoos not to be sufficient proof of gang membership. So this idea that somebody would get an MS-13 tattoo and not be affiliated with a gang, I guess is what they're thinking. But this is the thinking behind these memos and behind these policies, which are going to lead to higher crime rates, and it's unquestionably true in an era when crime is skyrocketing thanks to the anti-police policies, and other things. This is just going to add to that. It's going to reduce deterrents to committing crime for illegal aliens that are in this country, because now they know they can commit crimes and still stay. It used to be a deterrent factor that they would be deported. This will harm public safety, undermine the respect for the law, lead to further flooding of our borders, so we are going down the road of open borders and amnesty and that's what this is all about. CARLSON: All these people's presence is a crime. None of them has a right to be here in the first place, okay, so that -- I mean, that's sort of the more basic crime, I would say. Really quick, why would you suspend an operation designed to catch sex offenders? FAHEY: Well, if you read on -- my understanding of the second memo is the only people under this public safety prong are the people that were in custody at the time the memo was written. So these people that are fugitives and sex offenders don't even fall within this public safety exception. So they cannot go out and arrest him, if my understanding of the memo is correct. So why would they do that? I have no idea. It defies any logic or reason. It puts our communities at risk. But again, it is all about open borders, amnesty, keeping as many people in the country as possible. And this is, I think this is just the tip of the iceberg, Tucker. We're going to see more of this and we're going to have some crime victims that are going to be, you know, we know it could have been prevented now and there are going to be crime victims and what's the explanation going to be to them? CARLSON: It's all beyond belief. Jonathan Fahey, I appreciate your coming on. Thank you. FAHEY: Thank you. CARLSON: So Planned Parenthood makes a ton of money from abortion. Now, they have a new plan. They're getting involved in transitioning people's genders. Planned Parenthood, the very center of that debate, Abigail Shrier is here to explain their role, straight ahead. CARLSON: Planned Parenthood is America's number one provider of abortions, but pregnancy rates are declining dramatically. So now, Planned Parenthood has another revenue stream: kids who identify as transgender. One Planned Parenthood employee put it this way very bluntly, quote, ""Trans identifying kids are cash cows, and they're kept on the hook in terms of follow-up appointments, blood work, meetings, et cetera. Whereas abortions hopefully, are a one and done situation."" You probably might want to know about this. Abigail Shrier knows a lot about it. She is the author of ""Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters."" She's a brave voice. She joins us tonight. Abigail, thanks for coming on. ABIGAIL SHRIER, AUTHOR, ""IRREVERSIBLE DAMAGE"": Thank you, Tucker. CARLSON: Planned Parenthood is involved -- outline this for us, if you would. SHRIER: Sure. In the last decades, you know, as you said, the rates of abortion have plummeted in America. It's the lowest they've been since 1973 when Roe v. Wade was decided. So Planned Parenthood, which has, you know, a large infrastructure to support has found a second revenue stream that is incredibly lucrative. As you said, these young girls become lifetime patients once you medically transition, you become a lifetime patient and the drugs are extremely expensive. CARLSON: So Planned Parenthood takes a huge amount of Federal money. Does any of that money wind up as part of this revenue stream? SHRIER: I don't know. But I can tell you that, you know, this is something that has gone from, you know, 26 clinics were providing testosterone at Planned Parenthood clinics were providing testosterone only five years ago; now 210 Planned Parenthood clinics provide testosterone. So it is clearly a very big business for them. And they claim on their website to be the second largest provider of hormone treatments for trans-identified people. CARLSON: So we spend a lot of time talking about the trans question. We're lectured a lot about it, I think most people, including me have very little idea of what it means medically. You said that this is a long term commitment between the patient and the healthcare provider. What do you mean by that exactly? SHRIER: Well, to maintain the effects of something like testosterone, you need to stay on it. Otherwise, you will end up in this in-between looking state. For a woman to maintain the effects, the secondary sex characteristics of a man, she needs to stay on massive, massive doses. Now, that doesn't mean that some of the effects aren't permanent, many of them are, but she still has to maintain that appearance and she has to keep coming in for checkups to look at her blood levels. Now that said very often these teenagers who come in at 18, and yes, far below 18, depending on the state to a Planned Parenthood clinic, very often they never see a doctor. CARLSON: I mean, I think we know that there are long term health effects of flooding your body with hormones that you don't naturally produce. Do we know what the long term effects of this might be? SHRIER: Well, some of them include infertility, vaginal and uterine atrophy. They're at risk of cardiac events, you know, and of course, the great unknown which is that we've never done this to biological women for decades, and that's what we're doing now. So we really don't know all of the long term effects. CARLSON: Man, this is a conversation I think the country really needs to have, and I'm grateful that you're forcing it in some way, at great expense to yourself. So thank you for doing that. Thanks for coming on tonight. SHRIER: Thank you. CARLSON: So it's been a pretty heavy show. Sorry about that. We tried to lighten it up at some point, it is a little relentless. Tonight, it certainly was. So we're going to end with this. Rod Ponton is county attorney in Presidio County, Texas, and today, he had a little difficulty during a virtual hearing before a Texas District Court Judge. Here's what happened. JUDGE ROY FERGUSON, PRESIDIO COUNTY, TEXAS: Mr. Ponton, I believe you have a filter turned on in the video settings. You might want to find out. ROD PONTON, COUNTY ATTORNEY, PRESIDIO COUNTY, TEXAS: Can you hear me, Judge? FERGUSON: I can hear you. I think it's a filter it and -- PONTON: It is and I don't know how to remove it. I've got my assistant here, she is trying to, but I'm prepared to go forward with it. I'm here live. It's not that -- I'm not a cat. CARLSON: ""I am not a cat."" Probably the best line ever from a lawyer in American history, ""I am not a cat."" He took it well in the end. The lawyer told reporters quote: ""If I can make the country chuckle for a moment in these difficult times they're going through, I'm happy to let them do that at my expense."" In other words, the American spirit is not dead. It's just slightly more feline than normal. We appreciate that. Thanks for joining us tonight. We'll be back tomorrow and every night at 8:00 p.m. The show that is the sworn enemy of lying pomposity, smugness and groupthink. Buckle up, it's going to get better. In the meantime, Sean Hannity takes over 9:00 p.m. right now. SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: The cat is a star. That's all there is to it. CARLSON: It was good. HANNITY: All right, Tucker, thank you. Classification"
2021-01-15,"TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. Here are some interesting facts to think about. The New Hampshire Primary took place less than a year ago, it was February 11th, 2020. Now, think back, if you ask anyone who knows a lot about of politics on that day, who was going to be the Democratic nominee? Likely not one of them would have predicted Joe Biden. Biden came in fifth in New Hampshire, below Bernie Sanders, below Pete Buttigieg, below Amy Klobuchar, below Elizabeth Warren, just above some weird finance guy from California called Tom Steyer. In the end, Biden won a total of eight percent of the vote in New Hampshire. Now, for a former Vice President with 50 years of public service, that was a thoroughly humiliating performance, but it was not surprising. Even Democrats considered Joe Biden a sad old fool, worn out, empty, and confused, a ghost from a working-class union centered Democratic Party that disappeared decades before. Again, that was just in February, but next week, Joe Biden will be sworn in as President of the United States. How exactly did that all happened? How Biden went from a much mocked after thought, liked by some, but respected by nobody, to becoming the single most powerful man in the world at the age of almost 80 is a remarkable story. Someday when the mania recedes and we can agree to stop lying for a moment, it will be told. But in the meantime, here's part of that story. Joe Biden didn't seem scary. That was not a small thing in a year when our core institutions appeared to be falling apart. Biden's PR team told voters that Donald Trump he was a divisive figure. Even many of Donald Trump's own voters had to admit there was some truth in that, so Biden pledged to be the opposite. Biden promised to be America's gentle grandfather, gathering the nation around the hearth, soothing hurt feelings. Biden promised to unite the country. He said so again and again. JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: We want us to hear one another again, see one another again, respect one another again. So, let's begin the work to heal, to unite. The only way we can do it is to come together, to come together as fellow Americans, as neighbors. If we open our arms rather than brandishing our fists, we can, with the help of God, heal. CARLSON: Holy smokes, yes. Let's begin the work to heal, to unite, to come together as neighbors, to open her arms to the people around us. They are Americans, too. All of us live under God, we should be united. That was the pitch. He seemed to kind of mean it. Joe Biden would emulate President-elect Ronald Reagan after his contentious campaign with Jimmy Carter 40 years ago. According to Ken Khachigian, who was there, he is a speechwriter for Reagan quote, ""Among the first instructions Reagan gave was to be careful not to take a crack at the previous administration."" And that seemed like the kind of gentle, unifying approach that Joe Biden might take. No cheap shots. No attacks on its predecessor. It's time to heal, as Americans under God. That was the idea. Before long, Biden was on TV comparing sitting U.S. senators to Nazis. Last week, as thousands of Trump supporters gathered in Washington and tens of millions more of them watched on television, Joe Biden made certain to remind everyone of them that they voted for a disgusting man, probably because they are disgusting, too. BIDEN: He is not fit to serve. He is not fit to serve. He is one of the most incompetent Presidents in the history of the United States of America. He exceeded even my worst notions about him. He has been an embarrassment to the country. CARLSON: So you say Trump lost, but you are attacking him anyway, and the people who voted for him. Maybe you are not the loving grandfather dispensing wisdom in front of the fire, maybe that's not the presidency we are actually getting. Maybe we shouldn't be surprised because the real Joe Biden has a tendency to scream at people who disagrees with him. BIDEN: Focus on this man, what he is doing that no President has ever done. No President. No, I haven't taken a test. Why the hell would I take a test? Come on, man. That's like saying you, before you got in this program, you take a test, were you taking cocaine or not? What do you think, huh? Are you a junkie? I am not out of time. He spoke over time and I'm going to talk. Here's the deal. Here is the deal. The fact of the matter is, look at what's happening here. Well, that's not true. You are saying things you don't know what you're talking about. No one said that? Who said that? Who said that? You said I set up my son to work in an oil company, isn't that what you said? Get your words straight, Jack. CARLSON: That's not a loving conciliatory grandpa, that's angry grandpa. The Democrats are happy with that version of Joe Biden. They never had any interest in the conciliatory version. Appeals to unity won't in the end make them more powerful. With Trump leaving, Democrats are going to need a new enemy to hate, because hate is what holds their party together. Unfortunately, for you, they have now decided that enemy is the entire Republican Party and all of its voters, roughly half the country. If you think we are overstating it, watch Congressman Patrick Maloney of New York two days ago on MSNBC suggest that Republican lawmakers are so evil and so dangerous that it's possible one of them could smuggle a gun into Joe Biden's inauguration and shoot the President-elect dead as he is taking the Oath of Office. He said that. Watch. REP. PATRICK MALONEY (D-NY): It's a sad reality that we find ourselves in a place where the enemy is within and we cannot trust our own colleagues. But now, we can't be sure a Member of Congress won't bring a gun to the Inauguration. We can't be sure that a member of this body wouldn't be bringing people around the night before who the next day may be participating in the murder of the Capitol police officer. CARLSON: The reality that the other side is the enemy and may kill people at the Inauguration? What the hell are you saying? You know what he is saying? He is saying they are assassins, murderers and that's why we need tens of thousands of Federal troops in Washington to protect us, the good people from the evil people. That's more troops than we currently have in Iraq and Afghanistan combined. So, according to Patrick Maloney, the other side aren't only Republicans, they are Republican guards. There is a deadly insurgency within our borders. It's insane. Congressman Eric Swalwell though agrees with this wholeheartedly. Swalwell, you'll remember is so committed to unity that he once suggested using nuclear weapons against American gun owners who refused to allow him to confiscate their firearms. Swalwell appeared on MSNBC to accuse Republicans of plotting effectively a Civil War. REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA): I hope we understand, you know, if there was an inside job, whether it was members or staff or anyone working at the Capitol who helped these attackers better navigate the Capitol that that is going to be investigated. CARLSON: Yes, so the guy with the painted face and the Viking hat and the Chewbacca outfit was part of an inside job that was a coup attempt, and that's going to be investigated, says Swalwell. Investigated. You know what that means? Get ready for the paramilitary SWAT teams arriving in predawn raids with CNN camera crews in tow. Roger Stone was just a preview. So what other forms of unity can we expect in the Joe Biden administration? Well, you should ask John Fetterman. John Fetterman is the Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania. John Fetterman isn't necessarily against the entire Bill of Rights, but John Fetterman wants to be perfectly clear that going forward, the First Amendment does not apply to anything that offends him. Sorry, it just doesn't. JOHN FETTERMAN, LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR OF PENNSYLVANIA: So this idea saying Pennsylvania was rigged or that we were trying to ""steal the election,"" unquote, that's a lie. And that you do not have the right that is not protected speech. CARLSON: You don't have the right declares John Fetterman. In fact, words that annoy John Fetterman or that in any way might reduce his power or reflect poorly on his performance in office are quote, ""not protected speech."" Understand? That's unity. And that's why that when Democrats claimed the 2016 election, the one that got Trump elected was rigged by Russia, stolen by Vladimir Putin; that is protected speech because John Fetterman believes it's true. So to review: free speech is any speech that low IQ thugs like John Fetterman are okay with you expressing, but everything else is banned in the name of unity. And by the way, anything else is also racist. REP. CORI BUSH (D-MO): Let's be clear, this was a racist attempt to overturn an election. This was more about trying to disenfranchise the voices of the black, brown, indigenous peoples' voices. Trying to invalidate our votes. So I am I'm speaking up, you are going to hear that we are not going to let this go because this is a racist attempt. We have to call it what it is. It is white supremacy at its finest. CARLSON: So what you thought was a protest that became a mob that got out of control and became violent was in fact a specifically targeted effort to invalidate the votes of voters of color, indigenous voters. That's Cori Bush's position. Now, if you're wondering why someone like Congresswoman Cori Bush could continue to live in a country teaming with white supremacists, don't wander. In fact, shut your racist mouth right now, you are not allowed to talk, and that's another vital principle of unity. We can all live together in perfect harmony just as long as one side stays perfectly quiet and obeys. If they don't obey, we're going to have problems. What then? Well, thankfully, Joe Biden's brain trust is so committed to unity, they been thinking about what to do next, about how to bring unity permanently and for all time. Here is their plan. REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): Southern states are not red states, they are suppressed states, which means the only way that our country is going to heal is through the actual liberation of southern states. CARLSON: Oh, okay. In case you didn't hear, we are going to repeat it for you very slowly. The only way our country is going to heal -- and we are quoting, "" ... is the actual liberation of southern states."" That's a quote. Now, you might get in trouble if you suggested that what the Democrats really have in mind is a new version of reconstruction. Look up reconstruction if you're not familiar with that story. The details are worth knowing about. Well, we don't need to suggest that their plan, because Sandy Cortez of New York just to set it out loud. That's unity. Mark Steyn joins us tonight to assess this unified plan for healing and harmony. Mark Steyn, I've got to say, in seriousness, there are probably a lot of good-hearted voters who objected to the chaos of the last four years. It was too loud for them basically and they looked at Biden and they said, he is kind of out of it, but at least the drama will subside and maybe we can come together again. They seem to be doubling down on division and craziness to me. MARK STEYN, AUTHOR AND COLUMNIST: Yes, I think that's intentional. This is unity and healing in the Soviet sense where unity meant the absence of opposition. It is interesting to me that in the summer when we had this frenzy of cancel culture, what was being canceled was ""Gone with the Wind"" and the Washington Redskins and Kate Smith, and canceling was being done on the basis of changes in social mores on race and transgender issues and whatever else it was. We've moved on a stage from there now where cancel culture in a two-party system is canceling the people who voted for the other party. That guy from Pennsylvania, for example, in his state, two teachers are being investigated by their school boards just for having attended the Trump rally in Washington. They weren't at the Capitol. They didn't go near the Capitol. They didn't storm the Capitol, but they are being investigated anyway. And so, in a two-party system, what the Democrats are trying to do -- and are doing quite successfully at the moment is saying, okay, we've driven a stake in Trump, but that's not the point. The point is to drive a stake in the 70 million people who voted for Trump to say, you should be ashamed of yourselves, this is never to happen again. So we have actually -- we are actually now canceling political opposition in a two-party system where you basically ruin the reputations of the losing party, and there's only two parties. It's a lousy, stupid, frozen party system that's been the same for 150 years now and I regret that and it is not like anywhere else in the western world. But if it is a two-party system, and you demonize the voters of the other party, you're basically announcing this is a one-party state. Suck it up, losers. CARLSON: I look at them and I think, if they had any confidence at all in the program they plan to impose, they wouldn't be imposing it, they would be selling it. If you really believe that you have got a good idea, you tell people about it and they come to it voluntarily, right? You apostatize, you evangelize. They are not even bothering to tell you what the idea is. It is just shut up and obey. What does that tell you about them? STEYN: I think that's the logical conclusion of where they've been and actually, most of their basis have been whether you're talking about sexual identity or racial politics or any kind of identity politics, their position is, we don't want to win the debate, we want to cancel the debate. There is no need for the debate, these are settled issues. And that is why it's on this lunatic overdrive. Have you ever seen anybody less supremacist than the people who were driven to vote for Trump in 2016, their lives are hopeless. The mills, the factories have closed, their communities are awash in drugs. They are the least supremacist people in the United States. CARLSON: The one group whose life expectancy is in decline, and we are crushing them. It tells you everything about the people in charge. STEYN: Absolutely. CARLSON: Mark Steyn, great to see you, thank you. STEYN: Thanks a lot, Tucker. CARLSON: Well, if there's one thing that almost every journalist and Democratic Party official and Wesleyan University graduate in this country can agree upon -- this is virtually unanimous -- is that the police are racist, at least the cops who aren't on Capitol Hill at the moment, they're fine. But for most part, cops are so racist, they go around shooting unarmed black men for no reason whatsoever apart from the fact that they just enjoy it because they're racist. For most of the past year, they told us that nothing proved their point better than the case of Jacob Blake. Remember Jacob Blake. We were told Jacob Blake was shot in the back unarmed. He was just trying to break up a fight, and now, they shot him and paralyzed him, which by the way, for the record, it is sad as hell. But the key point was, there was no reason for it because he wasn't armed. And the city he lived in had to be burnt to the ground as a result just to teach those cops a lesson. Now, an update to the story. In his first television interview since he was shot by the cops last August in Wisconsin, Jacob Blake has admitted what we told you then, he was armed. He had a knife in his possession at the time of the shooting, but also dropped it before picking it up again. Blake made that admission to ""Good Morning, America"" yesterday during his first television interview since the shooting took place in August. As we said, he is now paralyzed from that. Watch. QUESTION: You walked away from the officers, after they tried to grab you - - JACOB BLAKE, SHOT AND SERIOUSLY INJURED BY POLICE OFFICER IN KENOSHA, WISCONSIN: I'm rattled. You know, I realize I had dropped my knife. I had a little pocket knife. So, I picked it up after I got off of him because they Tased me and I fell on top of him. I shouldn't have picked it up, only considering what was going on. At that time, I wasn't thinking clearly. QUESTION: You were thinking, once you get the knife into the car, you're going to get -- BLAKE: Throw myself to the ground. CARLSON: So, if you remember, and a lot of this is cloudy because they burned the city down right after it and we are very focused on that. A lot of people died. People died. But at the time, the family, the attorneys, everybody, and particularly the media told us a very different story. They told us this for months: he was unarmed. On, August 24th for example, CNN reported the "" ... police shooting of an unarmed black man, Jacob Blake."" And we are quoting there. Two days later, a CNN political analyst called April Ryan tweeted this, quote, ""In households across this nation, black families are having talks with their kids about why another unarmed black man #JacobBlake was shot by police."" Exclamation point. So for months, they terrified the country. April Ryan and people like that in our news media terrified American families, particularly American black families. You're going to be shot for no reason, unarmed. On January 5th, not that long ago, ""The Washington Post"" ran this headline. ""Police officers won't be charged in the shooting of Jacob Blake, an unarmed black man who shot seven times in the back in Kenosha, Wisconsin."" Now, we just want to pause and remind you yet again, we reported on the show what the police said at the time. He was armed. We had that information. It was public information. ""The Washington Post"" lied about it, so did CNN, so did virtually every news organization in this country. Again, after it was announced the officer wouldn't face charges last week, MSNBC kept repeating the lie. Watch. NICOLLE WALLACE, MSNBC ANCHOR: No charges will be brought against the police officer or any of the police officers involved in the shooting of Jacob Blake who is an unarmed black man who was shot. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You may recall, an officer shot Blake in the back seven times while he was unarmed. PAUL BUTLER, PROFESSOR, GEORGETOWN SCHOOL OF LAW: Another example of African-Americans not receiving equal protection of law. Mr. Blake was unarmed at the time that he was shot. CARLSON: Oh, it's all such a lie and they knew it was a lie and they told it anyway to divide the country, to make themselves more powerful. They probably left out all kinds of other kinds of context, too. Like he had an outstanding warrant on charges like trespassing, disorderly conduct, third- degree sexual assault. We told you that at the time, they didn't. They didn't care that Kenosha burned for weeks because of the lies they told. The whole point of this was to provide cover for politicians like Kamala Harris, politicians whose whole careers are predicated on the lie that America is a deeply racist country. People say they are proud of people like Jacob Blake. That was the goal. By the way, it worked, unfortunately. Well, the President's second impeachment didn't take very long this time around. It was all over in a day, but the hearing still produced some remarkable footage, some of it is actually kind of disturbing from a hygienic perspective. We've got that video straight ahead. CARLSON: We've got breaking scientific news that will be of interest to you. Now that Joe Biden is almost President, it turns out the coronavirus is completely different from what it was like last month. It turns out, coronavirus lockdowns are actually not necessary, and we are learning that from pretty major figures in the Democratic Party, like the Mayor of Chicago Lori Lightfoot, the Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo. Even the so-called scientific community. Do you still trust them? Wish we could. A new study in the ""European Journal of Clinical Investigations"" just found that mandatory lockdown orders -- and we are quoting now, "" ... may not provide the significantly more benefits to slowing the spread of the disease than other voluntary measures."" Now, if that sounds familiar, possibly it is because you've heard it on this show about 50,000 times from this man. His name is Alex Berenson. He is the author of ""Unreported Truths about COVID-19 and Lockdowns."" And he joins us tonight. Alex, thanks so much for coming on. How does it feel to have the so-called scientific community catch up with you, alone, much despised blogger, seriously? ALEX BERENSON, AUTHOR: I mean, Tucker, all I did was look at the evidence. By the way, this has happened with schools, too, as we know. You know, eight months ago, if we opened schools, kids were going to drop like flies. That turned out to be a total lie. What's amazing is that, yes, there are people -- you know, Lori Lightfoot is saying that bars should be reopened and restaurants should be reopened, but California is under a massive lockdown. And you know, all you need to do is realize that cases there have been -- they grew exponentially in November and December and the state went into lockdown in early December and it didn't make any difference. I mean, most of the state. There were just a couple of exceptions. Ireland was in lockdown October through December. They tried for a few days to lighten up, and they had to go back into lockdown, very hard lockdown, that has made no difference. Ireland has more cases than almost anywhere else in the world right now, as I say cases, I mean positive tests, as we know. The evidence isn't just that lockdowns don't really work, it is that they appear to be counterproductive, especially now that there is this new strain of the virus that seems to be spreading more quickly, at least a little bit more quickly. So what happens is in a place like Ireland or California, you lockdown, you have all of this sort of dry kindling and when the virus does take off, it just takes off like crazy. There's a large pool of uninfected people who get infected very rapidly. Look, if you want to be China, and right now, this has gone mostly unreported, yet another truth that has gone unreported, there are several Chinese cities that have gone into massive lockdown in the last couple of weeks. If you want to be an authoritarian government that locks down entire cities or regions after a single case or a handful of cases and imposes compulsory testing on millions of people, maybe you have a chance at stopping the virus that 98 or 999 people out of a thousand survive, otherwise you have to live with this. Lockdowns don't work. CARLSON: That's right. Why are you not the most highly regarded famous and lauded journalist in America? You should be. BERENSON: I'm the most disliked journalist in America. CARLSON: I am very aware of that, which tells you everything about contemporary journalism. I appreciate you coming on tonight, Alex Berenson. Thank you. BERENSON: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: If you're watching the impeachment hearings closely earlier this week, and probably not many people were, you were awarded with some pretty amazing footage that most people missed. It came courtesy of a Congressman from the tiny, but robust State of Rhode Island called David Cicilline, the former mob lawyer. We want to warn you, if you take the C.D.C. guidelines seriously, or if you are a just a clean person, this will turn your stomach. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Let us be very clear, what took place on January 6, 2021 was an act of domestic terrorism by right-wing sycophantic white supremacists. CARLSON: White supremacists -- that may have pulled your attention away, but look at David Cicilline. He sneezed all over his hands. Remember, this guy is a member in good standing of the party of science, so he knows what he is doing because he is a scientist. In fact, David Cicilline understands science way better than anyone else in Congress. In fact last year, he put on a clinic on proper mask usage. Watch. CICILLINE: Mr. Bezos founded Amazon in 19 -- excuse me, I'm going to remind Members of this Committee, unless you are speaking, our rules require you to wear a mask according to the attending physician -- I'm speaking about another member of this committee. CARLSON: Yes, I'll remind you -- he wipes and sneezes in his hair. Dr. Marc Siegel does not do anything like that. He is a FOX News medical contributor, author of the book "" COVID: The Politics of Fear,"" he joins us tonight. Dr. Siegel, thank you so much for coming on. What do you make of the sneeze? DR. MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR: Unbelievable. It is hypocrisy you just saw there, first of all. And when you say one thing and you do another, that's the politics of fear and then nobody wants to follow you as a leader, that's the first thing. Secondly, Tucker, I believe masks have usage if they are used properly with distancing and if you are actually to wear them properly the way physicians do, but the fact of the matter is that Congressman Cicilline has to learn something from me tonight. Let me tell you about a sneeze. We are always talking about asymptomatic spread, but this, like other respiratory viruses, Congressman, it spreads by sneezes. Did you know, Congressman, that sneezes travel 30 to a 100 feet per second? Did you know that a sneeze has been studied and could actually transmit a virus not three feet, not six feet, but over 20 feet, Congressman? Over 20 feet. And you know what? I'm going to give you some medical advice tonight, Congressman. You're not my patient, but you're a fellow Brown graduate like me. Here's my advice to you. If you sneeze, watch this, Tucker. If you sneeze into your mask, this is a surgical mask, I'm wearing it properly. If you sneeze, you leave the mask on while you are sneezing. You don't take it off and sneeze onto the side, you leave the mask on. And now, Congressman, may I call you, David. David, you're going to say to me, but the mask is wet, Doc, what do I do? The mask is wet from the sneeze. Here's what you do, Congressman. You take the mask off then for a second, you don't yell at Jim Jordan. You take the mask off for a second. You have a spare mask ready, look. I've got a spare. And you take your spare. You take your spare and you put your spare on. You get rid of the old mask, and then you wash your hands, and you are done. You wash your hands -- Tucker. CARLSON: So you are approaching this as a physician with the mind of a clinician, but what if the point of the mask was to train you to wear a uniform and to give David Cicilline unwarranted moral authority. Think about that, Dr. Siegel. Great to see you, thanks so much for coming on. SIEGEL: That's the real problem. CARLSON: That's the problem. Here is a real problem, if you care about free speech and living in a free country. The largest online gun form on the internet, certainly one of them, was just a target of censorship. This hasn't been widely known. Now, we are going to talk to the owner of the site who is a big figure in the sporting world. Right now though, you are seeing footage of Washington, D.C., boarding up and locking down. That video was shot by Nathan Furniss. It's hard to believe, but that's what Washington looks like. Just a few days to go until Joe Biden's inauguration. We will be right back. CARLSON: AR15.com is one of the most popular gun forms on the internet. This week, GoDaddy which is not supposed to be policing content, they are not your mom, they provide internet hosting services, took the remarkable step of yanking AR15.com offline. We asked GoDaddy today, why? And they told us this. ""We received a complaint regarding certain contents on the AR15.com. Our team investigated the content in question and confirmed it violated our terms of service because it incited violence."" Whatever that means. AR15.com is now back online with a new hosting provider. But it is a moment that we should pause and think about with Pete Brownell. He is the Chairman of the Second Adventure Group, the owner of AR15.com as well as the guy who runs Brownell, which if you are a sportsman, you know well. We are happy to have him on tonight. Pete, thanks so much for joining us. PETE BROWNELL, CHAIRMAN, SECOND ADVENTURE GROUP: Thank you, Tucker. CARLSON: In what world does GoDaddy have the right to end your ability to produce content? I didn't know that they could do that, or did. BROWNELL: Right, right. It was a surprise to us that that was the provider that we used that pulled us off the website. They are a registrar for those who don't know them and that's really the phone book for when you type that into your browser, it directs you to our servers. And they are the ones who said, we know longer want you because you apparently violated one of their policies, which is patently false. CARLSON: I mean, it goes without saying that it is a lie and whatever -- you know, they didn't explain the standard -- I mean, we don't even take this seriously. The reason that this is a chilling moment, and we wanted to hear it directly from you, is that it is clearly a vision of the future where you are not allowed to express your views on the Second Amendment, even, much less exercise it. Are you worried? BROWNELL: We are worried about this, specifically with this administration who has probably the worst policy or plans that are coming in on being very restrictive on firearm ownership, a much drastic -- they have a different view of how individual ownership should be regulated and the registered in the United States. And if our voices are silenced or half of the argument is not even considered or being allowed to speak in America today, that should be troubling for everybody, not just a pro Second Amendment individuals, but everybody out there in America should stand up and say, wait a second, this is not what the foundation of our country was built on. And when it comes to our civil liberty like the right to own firearms of an individual, we should all stand up and take note, specifically with not having a voice to talk to each other and raise awareness for some of the issues that are coming at us right now. CARLSON: Yes, I mean, did you ever -- you're from this country -- did you ever imagine that big companies wholly outside regulators of Congress apparently, could just kind of eliminate the First and Second Amendments, and there's nothing you can do about it. BROWNELL: No, it is very Orwellian in its approach. It's one of the things that you read about when you're in the 1950s and 60s with those books that you read in high school, and it becomes one of the things you just can't believe it is America that you grew up in as you're living in right now. And I think, regardless of where you stand politically, we should all take pause and make sure that we truly consider what kind of rhetoric is going around, and what kind of controls we are giving to a few when we start talking about being able to communicate to each other. This is about free speech, it is America. CARLSON: I just read a news story that said podcasts are problematic because they are a loophole in social controls, it's hard to censor a podcast. How long until private conversations will be considered a loophole? Seriously. BROWNELL: Right. When did free speech becomes something that the government needs to put a commission on and tell you what you can and cannot say? There are some restrictions -- I thought we were a free America here? CARLSON: I thought so, too. Pete Brownell, the Great Pete Brownell of Brownells, great to see you tonight. Thank you. BROWNELL: Thank you, sir. CARLSON: Well, last night, we played you tape from the CEO of Twitter, Jack Dorsey admitting that his campaign of censorship against Donald Trump really applies to you, and it's just the beginning. He made that clear in this video from Project Veritas. JACK DORSEY, CEO, TWITTER: We are focused on one account right now, but this is going to be much bigger than just one account, and it's going to go on for much longer than just this day, this week. I don't believe this is going away anytime soon, and the moves we are making today around QAnon, for instance, one such example of a much broader approach that we should be looking at and going deeper on. CARLSON: ""This is going to be much bigger than just one account."" Now, that may be of concern to the Jimmy Dore, host of ""The Jimmy Dore Show."" His views are on the opposite end from Donald Trump, but his views are still hated by a lot of the people in charge. So Jimmy Dore, how does this make you feel? JIMMY DORE, HOST, ""THE JIMMY DORE SHOW"": Well, it makes me feel really uncomfortable that this new censorship push is coming from the left, just like I warned the left when they were pushing evidence-free conspiracy theories called Russiagate and McCarthy smearing all their political enemies. That of course, whenever you do McCarthy smearing or Russiagating or things like that, you are propping up the surveillance tape. You are propping up the establishment and they are going to come back to bite you, and that's exactly what happened with Bernie Sanders. He got caught up with doing Russiagate, and of course, they smashed his campaign by Russiagating him saying that Russia was supporting him. Exactly. So, this scares me because it seems like on the left -- can I just tell you, the Capitol riot did not happen because we didn't have enough censorship. That is a ridiculous idea, okay. Silicon Valley has turned into an extension of the Democratic Party like Greenwald just experienced that, right? I mean, what is going on right now is crazy. Freedom of speech is the first in the Bill of Rights because it's important, because popular speech doesn't need protecting. It's unpopular speech that needs protecting. That's why it's first. The he war on terror was already used to take away our free speech rights, to take away our right of protection from invasive searches from the government. We live in a surveillance state. And now, they're going to use this even more -- Joe Biden has already said, he is going to use it. They're using it as a domestic terrorism threat. And let me just tell you something, they never said, we know who gets censored, people who are pro-war never get censored, people who tell the truth about war gets censored. CARLSON: Exactly. DORE: That's why I am being censored. That's why my gets throttled. That's why -- so I just lost 4,000 Twitter followers for no reason. I don't understand how the left has to keep relearning this over and over and over. The first person to beat the platforms was WikiLeaks and Julian Assange and this would be a great way for Donald Trump to stick the thumb in the eye of these people is to pardon Julian Assange if he knows what's good for freedom of speech and freedom of the press, he should take this moment and pardon Julian Assange. CARLSON: I totally -- I didn't used to think that, and I totally agree with it, partly because you convinced me through the force of your argument. I think that's absolutely right. I hope you will come back -- DORE: Can I just say -- CARLSON: Yes, please. DORE: Can I just say, Tucker, this all started with the failure of neoliberalism, why did Donald Trump get elected? So they couldn't ever come to terms with why he got elected, so they had -- so it was corporate lefty journalists who pressured social media outlets to start censoring people who weren't adhering to this official narrative. And that's what's going on, here and that's what scares -- neoliberalism is a failed ideology, and that's why they are now using censorship to control the narrative because they can't back it up. CARLSON: You made a really evocative point, which we don't have time to explore. I hope you come back and explain some time why people who are against pointless wars get censored, not those who are for them. No one will ever censor Bill Kristol and anyway, I hope you'll come back on that topic. Jimmy Dore, great to see you. Thank you. DORE: Thank you. CARLSON: Well, several major American cities have decided because we don't have cops right now to release thousands of violent criminals, all at once. We will tell you where it is happening and what the consequences have been, though you can probably guess. We will be right back. CARLSON: So Federal statistics show that millions of your fellow Americans have given up trying to find a job. Think about that, they've given up. Is there anything sadder? Not to the Democrats, they believe the real problems is that convicted criminals are oppressed, and we need to get on that right away. New York's Attorney General for example is suing the NYPD for its brutal handling of BLM rioters, and the Commonwealth of Virginia, which has gone insane, the Governor there, the guy with the Klan outfit is busy advocating for felons rights. GOV. RALPH NORTHAM (D-VA): Virginia is one of just a few remaining states where if you have a felony conviction, someone has to act to restore your civil rights to vote or run for office. It's not automatic, but it should be. So I've made it a priority: restoring civil rights for more than 40,000 people. CARLSON: Oh, so says Governor Blackface. So if you've been convicted of felony, you should be allowed to vote, but you should not be allowed to have a gun. So we trust you to choose our next President, but not to go deer hunting. How, Governor Blackface does that work? No one ever explains it, but it's happening all over the country, and we know where it goes. We know where it leads. It is going to make your neighborhood more dangerous. We have the data. In Hawaii, for example, a new study shows that more than half of inmates released because of COVID went on to commit new crimes, more than half, really. In Seattle, a judge released a 19-year-old man called Isaiah Clay Lewis even though he was facing an assault charge and within hours, guess what he did? He committed a horrifying attack you are now seeing on the screen. Lewis is also a suspect in shooting in the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, remember that? Craziness. Christopher Rufo is a research fellow at the Discovery Institute and contributing editor at ""City Journal"" and a man who actually does reporting on topics that matter. We are happy to have him on tonight. Mr. Rufo, thank you for joining us. So the idea is, even as the country becomes more dangerous, we need to make it even more dangerous by letting convicted felons out of prison early. What is the idea here and what is its effect? CHRISTOPHER RUFO, RESEARCH FELLOW, DISCOVERY INSTITUTE: Well, the idea is that we are moving from a system of justice which treats people equally under the law to a system of social justice which uses the criminal justice system, courts, prisons, and prosecutors, to try to reorganize and redeem society. And what that means in practicality is that if you are a member of a protected class, if you're homeless, if you're a Black Lives Matter protester, you're treated one way. And if you are a member of an unprotected class, if you're a homeowner or a conservative anti-lockdown protester, they throw the book at you. And what we are seeing is that the system of social justice ends up being a system of separate and unequal justice depending on what you look like and what your beliefs are. CARLSON: So, I think we might be underselling the story. So, we opened by saying this is going to make your neighborhood more dangerous, which obviously it is, but it also raises the question how can you have a society that as an official matter of policy doesn't deliver equal justice? I mean, seriously. RUFO: Yes, that's exactly right. I think that for long time conservatives, we know there's been a double standard, but this is really institutionally the first time you are seeing a kind of separate system, and I think it's really unfortunate, because what it's done is that it has enabled the kind of low level quality of life crimes that create the ideal conditions for what we are seeing now, which is the highest single year increase in murder rate in American history, which was 2020. And yet, the media kind of white washes and blankets over what's happening on the streets because they want to subordinate that to the dominant Black Lives Matter narrative, the dominant idea that there were mostly peaceful protest last year and also, the dominant idea unfortunately that crime is sometimes permissible depending on who is committing it. CARLSON: Yes, if you politicize the justice system, things actually fall apart, for real, and we are doing that, intentionally. Chris Rufo, you have really been indispensable on this subject and I appreciate you coming on tonight, I hope you'll come back. RUFO: Thank you. CARLSON: Lots of news today, a lot more news, just five days until the inauguration, and we are back in just a moment. CARLSON: We are out of time for tonight and the week. Time, the one thing you will never have enough of. The good news, we will be back Monday evening, 8: 00 p.m., the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink. Have a happy, well-deserved weekend with the ones you love. Hopefully, filled with gratitude for all we've been given. See you Monday. Classification"
2021-01-08,"TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. The crackdown on America's civil liberties is coming. We told you that yesterday. It turns out it didn't take long. It is here now. And it is unprecedented. And it will have consequences. This will cause extremism. Actions taken to suppress extremism will cause it. Those unintended consequences, we don't know. It's very clear what's happening and what will happen. Here's the first news. Just days after Donald Trump called for breaking up the Big Tech monopolies in order to preserve democracy, the Big Tech monopolies have silenced him. Twitter has just announced the sitting President has been banned permanently from the platform that is his primary means of public communication. Of course, they waited until the Democratic Party took power, and they shut it down. They are in control now. Silicon Valley oligarchs are more powerful than the President of the United States and they want you to know it. Everywhere, the assault on speech accelerates. Glenn Greenwald is an independent journalist, co-founder of ""The Intercept"" now found on ""Substack."" We're happy to have him on tonight. You are a longstanding civil libertarian. Glenn, thanks for joining us. Please assess what you're seeing now in the United States. GLENN GREENWALD, JOURNALIST: Well, one thing I think that we're clearly seeing is the initiation of a new war on terror, which I don't say lightly. I say that because the Biden administration, what will be the Biden administration, in about a week is saying explicitly that they want, first of all a new law to further criminalize domestic terrorism, even though every act that constitutes domestic terrorism is already criminalized. What they want to do is increase their power to monitor political groups, to infiltrate them, to criminalize activities that currently are not criminalized, nor should they be whether it be advocacy of speech, or other things. They're saying they want a new law similar to the way that the 9/11 attack and the emotions surrounding it was instantly seized upon to institute a whole series of new laws that endured to this very day. Secondly, they are explicitly saying that they believe that domestic terrorism, so this war on terror is not going to be directed at foreign, non-state actors or terrorist groups or foreign countries like China or Iran or Russia, it's going to be directed inward, as the greatest threat to national security and we've talked about this before that this is what they're likely going to do, because they have been focused for so long, media outlets have, the Democratic Party has on Donald Trump and increasing fear levels about him. That's been the key to their profits and their power. What will happen once he is gone, their strategy has always been clear: to inflate the risk of what they call white supremacist terrorism, which increasingly means nothing more than being a Trump supporter and then treating people in the United States who fall into that category the way you treat terrorists. You monitor them, you surveil them, you restrain them, you detain them, and this is what they're saying explicitly. And the Silicon Valley component of this is particularly menacing, Tucker, because these companies have greater power than any corporations in the history of the world, not just well, but the amount of data that they have on us. And now the control that they exercise over our political discourse, a tiny handful of tech oligarchs are more powerful than any nation state. They determine what we can hear, what we can speak, what is true and what is false with zero accountability and zero transparency. They overwhelmingly donated to the Democratic Party and support the Democratic Party. They are part of that coalition. And Jennifer Palmieri, a top level, long term, adviser to the Clintons boasted on Twitter that the reason that Facebook and Silicon Valley are now censoring the enemies of the Democratic Party is because they know the Democrats are now in control of the key committees and have to do their bidding in order to get what they want. But the reality is, they are the ones who wield power, Silicon Valley does, and the rest of us are subject to their undemocratic and unaccountable whims. CARLSON: You've been saying this for 20 years, and almost 20 years ago, you said laws like this will be used against American citizens. And I want to confess, I thought you sounded paranoid at the time, but you were right, and I want to acknowledge that now. You were right and we should be really, really concerned. Glenn Greenwald, I know we will be talking to you a lot. I appreciate it. Thank you. GREENWALD: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: So, this is coming from everywhere, all of a sudden, and we're going to unpack what we know at this hour. But we do know that over the last 24 hours, Twitter specifically has banned a number of different conservative accounts, not just the President. At the same time, the Chinese Communist Party, the Ayatollah of Iran still have their accounts because they're not a threat to the ruling party here. Tonight, a competing social media service, Parler, which we told you about is seeing massive and unprecedented surge in traffic. The site even experienced server outage because of new users tonight. Why? A couple of reasons. Mostly this: Parler is a free speech alternative to Twitter. They don't censor. You can say what you want. The President is on Parler and that has drawn a lot of people who realize they are being suppressed by Twitter. Parler is succeeding. What happens now? Of course, Silicon Valley is trying to kill it. Google has just removed Parler without any warning from its App Store. Apple and Amazon, which provide services that keep Parler -- which keep services like Parler online have also threatened to shut Parler down. Amy Peikoff is the Chief Policy Adviser at Parler and she joins us tonight. Amy, thanks so much for coming on. This seem to come out of nowhere, how big a threat to your company is this. AMY PEIKOFF, CHIEF POLICY ADVISER, PARLER: I mean, this is very huge, because Apple in particular carries our app on the App Store. And as far as I know, technically, there's no other way to deliver it. So if they choose to withdraw their services and hosting us on their store, were toast there. And you know, most people like our app. Our app is a very nicely functioning piece of software. And then in terms of Amazon, Amazon is also raising some problems and I'm not sure how serious that is yet, because I have yet to speak with them, I will later today. And they provide server for us and if they were to remove their services, then we'd be down. As it is, we're having, you know, some difficulties now with the uptick in traffic, but if they took their service away, we'd be gone. CARLSON: I mean, there's a huge amount -- it's impossible to overstate the amount of filth and political extremism, explicit violence, pornography, whatever, on the internet. That's what the internet is. PEIKOFF: Yes, it's everywhere. CARLSON: It's everywhere. PEIKOFF: Yes. CARLSON: But it's Parler that is being singled out. I mean, it's kind of impossible not to conclude this is political repression. PEIKOFF: Really, because I think we do have the reputation as being the conservative platform, although we are nonpartisan. That is what everybody sees us as. We do see this as being politically singled out. The other thing is that we are competing with other platforms who have decided that they want to surveil the people on their platform 24/7, without any particularized suspicion, and you know, on the one hand, people don't like to live in the world of Orwell's 1984. And then on the other hand, a lot of people seem to want to pressure social media to do more to moderate as they call it, content on their platforms. But that would require 24-hour surveillance. So we don't think that that is consistent with the principles of America. CARLSON: So just to be clear for our viewers who aren't familiar with your company and your app, you're just trying to provide a place for people to say what they think. You're not trying to put Amazon out of business or dethrone Apple or force anybody else's carrier to drop their service, you just want to be left alone and do your thing. Am I mischaracterizing that? PEIKOFF: Yes. I mean, we would just like to provide a place where people can come and they can speak freely, that they're not going to be fact checked, they're not going to be told what to think, what they can read, et cetera. And also, we do not data pillage. We don't data mine them. We don't turn them into commodities and try to monetize them. And so we would just like to provide that service. And of course, like everybody else, we were horrified by a lot of the incitement that was going on this week, and we are doing everything that we can, within our principles to, you know, deal appropriately with that content. And you know, we work with law enforcement as well. But that content has been everywhere this week. This has been a very unusual week and to be singled out, we think is quite unfair. CARLSON: Well, that means it is just -- it's political pressure. Period. Now Google, we asked why they did this, and they sent a relatively long statement. We're just going to read a snippet of it to you on the air. ""We're aware of continued posting in the Parler app that seeks to incite ongoing violence in the U.S. It continues. In light of this ongoing and urgent public safety threat, we are suspending the app's listings from the Play Store until it addresses these issues."" Okay, so they're accusing you of inciting violence. PEIKOFF: They are putting on us the responsibility for every piece of incitement that is posted there. And the nature of an open platform, a free and open town square is that we do not take action on people until we are aware of a situation. It is particularized suspicion. You do not surveil -- CARLSON: So let me just ask you really quick. I mean, how much of the world's kiddie porn goes through Gmail? How many Gmail accounts you've been used to order plastic explosives? How many insurrections have been planned on Google? Like a lot. PEIKOFF: Sure. CARLSON: And so -- right. I mean, this is a completely arbitrary standard applied to you because they don't like the politics of the people who use your site. PEIKOFF: I mean, it's looking that way. I'm hoping it's not that way, but it's looking that way and it is coming in sooner than I would have expected it. CARLSON: Yes. Well, it's all happening at once this Friday night. It's happening all this Friday night. We're going to look back on this night. Amy Peikoff, appreciate your coming on tonight. PEIKOFF: Thank you, Tucker. CARLSON: So as we said, Twitter has permanently suspended the President from its app. The question is, how far will this go? And what will its effects be? Craig Dillon is a former adviser to the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He ran Johnson's social media accounts. He joins us tonight. Craig, where do you think this is headed from here? CRAIG DILLON, FORMER ADVISER TO THE BRITISH PRIME MINISTER BORIS JOHNSON: Well, I think they've set themselves a dangerous precedent. The question is, you know, who do they ban next? Are the Chinese accounts coming down? You know, the Supreme Leader of Iran regularly tweets. You've got the Venezuelan leader, he is using Twitter all the time. So where does this stop? Do they -- are they going to ban all of these people? Or is it just particularly ones that they don't like? CARLSON: So in this country, and I'm sure it's similar in the U.K., these platforms are our public square. This is how people sort out their political differences, how they learn about politics, and many other things. So when you shut these down, you are isolating people. It seems to me, you are ensuring the rise of real extremism in this country. I mean, censorship makes people paranoid and crazy, and frustrated and angry and sometimes violent. They must know that. Why are they doing this? DILLON: Well, they're seeing unbelievable amounts of pressure from various people in their side of society to ban him and do all these sorts of things. It's an interesting decision for them to make. I imagine they took a lot of debating over it. But as you say, this is going to push people onto, as we've already heard, places like Parler and things like that. So it's basically just segregated the people now. You know, the only people that are going to be using Twitter are going to tend to be left-leaning people, whereas right-wing people are going to go on to Parler and places like that. It's just made -- both sides are going to be an echo chamber and it's not good for democracy. CARLSON: No, and it's an attack on people and they feel under siege. This is -- we're turning up the temperature too high. These companies are doing that, I think. Craig, it's great to see you. Thank you. So what's interesting given that CNN calls itself a news network, a journalistic enterprise is that CNN has not only joined in, but in fact has been at the forefront of the efforts to squelch opposition to their worldview, to censor anything they don't like. And of course, at the center of their obsession, is this show. BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: Tucker Carlson -- DON LEMON, CNN HOST: Tucker Carlson. ANTONIO FRENCH, FORMER ST. LOUIS CITY ALDERMAN: Tucker Carlson. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Tucker Carlson. KEILAR: Tucker Carlson. LEON: FOX News host, Tucker Carlson -- CARLSON: So we're flattered, obviously, and why wouldn't you be when Don Lemon pronounces your name correctly, but there's something darker afoot here, and that is that CNN is working, explicitly saying they are, to take FOX News off the air, just as the President's Twitter account was deleted - - to take FOX News off the air. They think they can do it. We'll tell you how, after the break. CARLSON: This morning, CNN announced that it is working to force the FOX News off the air and run this company out of business. A number of prominent Democrats including officeholders support that effort. CNN staffers have already contacted the six major cable carriers in this country, those are the companies that carry our signal into your home and pressured them to drop FOX News. Why? On the pretext this show is directly responsible for the -- and others on the -- are directly responsible for the violence at the U.S. Capitol this week. It is time, CNN announced quote, ""The TV carriers face questions for lending their platforms to dishonest companies that profit off of disinformation and conspiracy theories."" So here you have a news company calling for censorship. You have a TV network demanding that media conglomerates ban its competitors. That's terrifying. But it's also -- if we are being completely honest here -- kind of amusing, because you can just imagine CNN's blustery little dwarf King, calling into his morning staff call yesterday. He spent a long night sitting on the tiny throne in his apartment, feet dangling just above the floor, watching FOX News and getting angrier and angrier. By the time he reaches his minions in the CNN newsroom to deliver the day's orders, the dwarf king's fleshy face is quivering like Jell-O and crimson with rage, ""Make them stop,"" he screams, ""Make them stop."" The minion jolt to attention. The first to her battle post is a former homecoming queen from Orange County who is eager to prove her chops. She's not a primetime anchor, she'd like to be, but she's still just a newsreader, a former co-host of a radio show on a contemporary hit station in Yakima, Washington, called ""Billy Blue and Brianna to the Morning Zoo."" Not everyone takes her seriously. She wants to be taken seriously and this is her chance. So she tries to remember the dwarf King's orders, ""Stop Fox."" That was the main command. Then there was that stream of consciousness part, the part where the boss was breathing so heavily, it was hard to make up the words. There was white supremacy, insurrection, domestic terrorism, something like that. She tries to connect the dots. It's confusing, but she is pretty sure the word ""insurrection"" was in there, for sure. Someone insurrected maybe or acted insurrectingly, something like that. No, it was definitely insurrection. So she decides to look up the word in the dictionary to see what it means. Here's what happened next. KEILAR: It was an insurrection. Take Merriam Webster's word for it, ""Insurrection: an act or instance of revolting against civil authority or an established government."" Knocking down barriers, knocking down gates, pushing police out of the way. Police would be the civil authority as described in the definition of insurrection. They broke windows and doors. They vandalized offices. CARLSON: Take Merriam Webster's word for it. That's Mrs. Merriam Webster to you. But here's the problem. This show, she explained, refused to call that obviously highly insurrectionary event an insurrection, literally didn't use the word -- just refused. I mean, seriously. Who would do that? Well, if you really want to know who would do that, a white person would do that, a privileged white person, someone who presumably unlike her coworkers at CNN and in fact, the dwarf King himself who is both white and privileged, afflicted with something called white privilege. So much white privilege, in fact that it blinded this person, because that's the thing about white privilege. If you keep doing it, you go blind. That's what the boss said. KEILAR: Tucker Carlson rolls his eyes at the idea of systemic racism, at white privilege, but perhaps he should roll those eyes on over to a mirror. It is entirely fantastical to think that crowds of black or brown Americans would have been treated as the mostly white insurrectionists at the Capitol were on Wednesday. CARLSON: Oh, the moral lecture from the morning doo lady. Perhaps he should roll his eyes on over to a mirror, assuming you can even do that, when you've been blinded by white privilege, because white people can't see themselves, right? But maybe they should see themselves, they might stop insurrecting. Stop being so white and privileged. It went on like this for an entire segment. You can look it up on the internet. In a way, that's the good news. With enemies like this, FOX News will be around for a long, long time. Jason Whitlock is a longtime journalist. He runs ""Outkick."" We're happy to have him on tonight. Jason, thanks for coming on. So the question I have is, have you ever seen -- and you've been in competitive journalism or sports journalism, but you've been -- you've competed against other news outlets your whole life. Have you ever seen an attempt by one to get the authorities to take the other one offline, to silence it? JASON WHITLOCK, OUTKICK.COM: Tucker, we're living in the craziest time of our lifetime, and maybe after the Civil War, the craziest time in the history of the United States. CARLSON: Yes. WHITLOCK: And nothing surprises me. It really doesn't, and it speaks -- what CNN is trying to do speaks to the level of fear, and clearly the level of disruption that President Trump has caused or potentially could cause. They're just trying to silence any and everyone who doesn't demonize this guy and compare him to Adolf Hitler and the worst people in the world. CARLSON: What happens when you try and do that? And can you do it? I mean, I don't think I know anyone who has thought more about social media and its effects on the country than you have. Can you really silence people? And if you try, what comes next? WHITLOCK: Well, I certainly think you can, and they're doing it and have been pretty successful with doing this for a long time. They have amplified the voices that they agree with and they have diminished the voices they disagree with. They have crucified Trump supporters, and I just want people to think about this. And listen, I don't agree with the way President Trump has handled himself in all situations. But he has picked on other elites. He has gone after the U.S. President Barack Obama. He has gone after the mainstream media, he has gone after celebrities. The media, and the elites have gone after working class people. Trump supporters are not elites. They don't have major platforms. They are the people. There is an attack on the people. Whether you agree or disagree with them, you cannot demonize 74 million Americans and say all of their complaints are racist, or sexist, or they're Nazis. You're baiting America for a Civil War. CARLSON: That's exactly right. And that is the distinction. And I do think you're -- I don't know if you're overstating it, I mean, this is going to cause extremism, like dangerous extremism. I'm very worried about it. But your point, I think, is the key one, they're punching down. Trump is punching laterally or up. And there's a huge difference between those two things. WHITLOCK: Listen, in 1620, four hundred years ago, people fled England because they wanted freedom of expression, freedom of religion, and here we are 400 years later and we're stripping freedom of religion, freedom of expression. We're silencing people we disagree with. This is un-American and it's crystal clear. We need some real leadership in this country. If President-elect Joe Biden wants to step out here and offer up some real unity and peace, make peace with Trump supporters, treat them like human beings even if you disagree with them. CARLSON: Right. WHITLOCK: That's the American thing to do. CARLSON: Treat them like human beings, even if you disagree with them. Amen. Jason Whitlock, thank you for that. Great to see you. So we don't want to suggest that it's just the President who is being silenced or just FOX News that's under attack. They are trying to destroy everyone who doesn't agree with them. Amazing. We'll have more than that throughout the show. But we want to take a break from the sadness and bring you a hopeful and happy story, and it comes from our friend, Dave Portnoy, who has carved out his own space to help people and he's done it and we'll tell you how we did it, after the break. CARLSON: Hey, so as we've been telling you, the President has been permanently banned, his account deleted from Twitter, but he just sent this from his POTUS account, roll that back a little bit so I can read it, if you don't mind -- other direction. This is what the President has just sent out on the permanent President of the United States account on Twitter quote, ""As I've been saying for a long time, Twitter has gone further and further in banning free speech. And tonight, Twitter employees have coordinated with the Democrats and the radical left in removing my account from their platform to silence me and you, the 75 million great also look at the possibilities of building out our own platform in the near future. We will not be silenced. Twitter is not about free speech. They're all about promoting a radical left platform where some of the most vicious people in the world are allowed to speak freely. Stay tuned."" As we read this, all happening in real time, as you can see, Twitter took that down as we read it. There's never been a night like this in my lifetime. So there's a lot of chaos going on and we wanted to take a break in the middle of it to tell you something happy. Dave Portnoy as his day job, runs Barstool Sports. He's watched the country get poorer. He wanted to help. He has now raised tens of millions of dollars to help small businesses stay alive during these lockdowns. One of these small business owners recently spoke to him by phone to explain what that money meant to her. Listen. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: My whole body is numb right now. DAVE PORTNOY, FOUNDER, BARSTOOL SPORTS: I'm glad we could help. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes. You guys are angels. This is -- we've been feeling so abandoned and just been so scared and numb. Thank you so much for taking care of the people that have seemed to be forgotten. CARLSON: So the rest of us are arguing about how big the checks could be -- should be, and Portnoy just decided, I'm going to do it myself, raise the money and give some people who need it. Kind of an amazing story. You'd think it would be everywhere. It isn't. It's been pretty much ignored, the Barstool Sports Fund by the media. But this week, some of the press are taking a different approach. They're angry and they're trying to destroy Barstool Sports. ""The San Francisco Chronicle,"" for example, it is a garbage paper, wrote, the woman you just saw was, quote, ""Not aware of Portnoy's history of making racist and misogynistic remarks or the accusations of sexual harassment against him."" Because no good deed goes unpunished, apparently. Dave Portnoy joins us tonight. First of all, Dave, you did it. I knew that you would. I think it's a really moving story. It's a great story. Why aren't more people celebrating it? PORTNOY: We're starting to pick up steam, but, who knows? There's agendas. It's sad. I mean, obviously, I come on this show, so you get painted with a certain brush which, I am sure you are aware. CARLSON: Right, right. PORTNOY: You know, we're just trying to help people. We're just trying to help people. I don't care whether you're Democrat, Republican, left, right, green, yellow, black, or white. There's people and they need money. And these videos that we're doing show it and I'll go anywhere. Tucker, you invited me, you helped launch it. But I will literally go on anywhere. So credit to the ""Today Show."" They did a very nice piece on it. It helped us. CARLSON: Good. PORTNOY: So you know, this is one of those issues that I'm glad we're helping. But the fact that anybody -- there should be nobody who has, you know anything against it. This is just people helping people in the truest sense. And we are getting in the $20 million, we're close to $21 million. We've had people reach out, but why -- you know, and FOX has been great promoting it, they have. But everybody should, because the more publicity we get, the more small businesses we can help and it spans everywhere. So I don't have that answer. I'm just focused to get publicity, to get money, and get it to the people who need it. CARLSON: Now, you guys are really successful. I don't think you're quite as big as Blackstone or Goldman Sachs. I won't make you answer it. But I mean, where are their funds, by the way? Seriously. The people who are getting -- you know, where is Jeff Bezos's fund? Sincere question. Like, what the hell? Why is this left to you to do? You run a sports site? Like what is this? PORTNOY: I have no idea. I will say and we're just getting ready to tweet it. I'm happy to say, Elon Musk is going to help us. So I think that will go a long way. But I don't know. Maybe they don't know about it. I don't know what they do. Listen, that's almost in a weird way, the trauma of what we're doing is just everyday people across every walk of life reaching out unsolicited saying, can I give you $50.00? Can I give you $100,000.00? They just want to help, and it is the beauty of this country. There's so much chaos and bad, but there is a lot of good. This country is still great. CARLSON: Yes. That's right. PORTNOY: There's people who want to help. CARLSON: That's exactly right. And that's why I was excited to talk to you tonight. What kind of people you've been giving the money to? PORTNOY: It's all walks. We literally get all walks of life, but small business restaurants, bar owners, dry cleaners, you name. It is tough. And not surprisingly, the states that have strictest lockdowns, California and New York, Massachusetts, a lot of applicants from those states. But these are people who have been in business, that first woman, that's the oldest bar west of the Mississippi in San Francisco. It's been around since 1830. It's their life brand. They put everything into it. To lose a bar like that and have nobody pay attention, that's why these people are breaking down. For the first time, finally, you see we've been here for 200 years. It's sad. It's sad. CARLSON: It's just crushing, and you are making a difference. I never say that because it sounds so dopey, but actually you are and I'm grateful. I know they are, too. Dave Portnoy, thank you. PORTNOY: Thanks. CARLSON: So your Civil Rights are disappearing. Again, that's not cable news hype, it is actually happening. We've spent the last 40 minutes telling you how. Just yesterday, when no one was looking, Joe Biden nominated someone to the Justice Department who will change the way that Civil Rights law is enforced in this country. We will tell you who she is and what's likely to happen when she takes the job. We'll be right back. CARLSON: Civil rights apply to everyone. That's the definition. Civil Right is universal. When Civil Rights apply only to some people, whether it's people with the right politics or gender or skin color, they are not Civil Rights, they are meaningless, actually. Many Democrats no longer believe that though. The insurrection talk? All a pretext to change the definition of the term Civil Rights. In less than two weeks, Democrats will have complete control the Federal government. Joe Biden will be the President. Where does he stand on Civil Rights? We got some clarity on that question this week. You probably missed it during all of the overheated coverage of the last 24 hours. Well, Joe Biden has appointed a woman called Kristen Clarke to run the D.O.J. Civil Rights Division. Now, you may not have heard that name, you'll hear it soon. We'll sum it up this way. Appointing Kristen Clarke to head the Civil Rights Division is like hiring Beto O'Rourke to lead the NRA. Kristen Clarke doesn't believe in Civil Rights. She believes in identity politics. In March 2018, we interviewed her and she admitted that on the air. Watch. KRISTEN CLARKE, BIDEN APPOINTED D.O.J. CIVIL RIGHTS DIVISION HEAD: We want people who are qualified and experienced especially at the helm of our nation's most important Federal agencies. But we also need to make sure that those agencies reflect the growing diversity of our country, and I'm not just talking about racial diversity, I'm talking about gender diversity and ethnic diversity. At every turn with this administration, we've seen efforts to turn the clock back. CARLSON: Do you think that airlines should apply the same diversity rules you're calling for here, that they shouldn't take the people who score the highest on the pilot tests, but that they should hire also on appearance, the way people look? CLARKE: Every workplace, whether you're talking about airlines ... CARLSON: Oh, so pilots to heart surgeons, too? CLARKE: ... or Federal agencies should hire the best, but should place a premium on diversity and Secretary Zinke -- CARLSON: But which is more important, the way that you look or what you do -- what you're capable of doing? So like when you're flying a plane, how important is it what you look like? Your appearance? CLARKE: Incredibly important. CARLSON: Appearance is incredibly important. CLARKE: And it's also important that we have -- it is also important that we place a premium on diversity and the fact that we have people in this administration -- CARLSON: But diversity means appearance, it means what you look like. You're talking about the shallowest possible criteria that it is your -- CLARKE: No, no. CARLSON: It is literally your shade, that's what you're saying. If you mean like diversity of skills, I'm totally with you. But when you were little, did you ever think you'd be arguing to judge people primarily on how they look? CLARKE: You know, I'm talking about gender diversity. I'm talking about racial diversity, Tucker. CARLSON: Okay. But that's -- those are outward signs. CLARKE: Eighty nine percent of President Trump's judicial nominees have been white male. They have been white male. CARLSON: But are they bad? CLARKE: Many of them are horrible. CARLSON: I thought you're speaking in foreign language to me because -- CARLSON: Like nominating -- CARLSON: Oh, they're bad because of their skin color. You really would have to have gone to Choate and Harvard to have ideas like that, of course, she did. Quite an impressive person -- Choate and Harvard. So she cares about racial diversity. In fact, she cares about it so much, she wants to penalize Asian and white applicants in college admissions. We are not making that up. This is Civil Rights according to Kristen Clarke, if you have the wrong skin color, you don't get into college. She will end the D.O.J.'s lawsuit against Yale University over its openly racist admissions practices if you are Asian or white, maybe South Asian, too. Your Civil Rights are not as important to the head of the D.O.J.'s new Civil Rights Division. If that sounds a little backwards to you, you should know that Kristen Clarke is not stopping there. She also thinks identification cards are racist, but only in certain situations. So if you buy a gun, of course, you have to show ID, that's not racist. But if you want to vote, you shouldn't be allowed -- be forced to show ID because that's racist. In September of 2017, she explained the reasoning behind this on the show. CARLSON: Are there really millions of people who don't have a photo ID? And you know, the answer is no, there aren't, because there can't be. CLARKE: There are -- there are 600,000 people who don't have a conceal and carry permit or a passport or a driver's license. CARLSON: Okay, people have a driver's license or a passport or else they can't live in this country. CLARKE: But there -- but, Tucker, there -- CARLSON: So here is my question, is it racist to require a photo ID to get a job or stay in a hotel or buy a gun or fly a plane? CLARKE: No. CARLSON: So why is it racist to ask when you vote? CLARKE: The right to vote is the most important right in our democracy, and we don't need to erect ... CARLSON: No, it's coequal with the -- no, hold on. CLARKE: ... hurdles and barriers that make it harder for ordinary Americans to vote. CARLSON: Peter Kirsanow is Commissioner on the U.S. Civil Rights Commission. He joins us tonight. Peter Kirsanow, thanks so much for coming on. It doesn't sound like she believes in the most basic principle in the country, which is we are all created with equal value. It doesn't sound like she believes that to me. PETER KIRSANOW, COMMISSIONER, U.S. CIVIL RIGHTS COMMISSION: Well, you know, if you review the testimony that she presented to the Civil Rights Commission during our hate crimes briefing, it suggests that she proposes a reversion to Obama-era policies that posit that virtually every racial disparity in the country is the result of systemic racism or structural racism and that leads to certain conclusions. And one of them is -- and she testified in the hate crimes briefing is a focus on hate crimes. And if you look at it, this is beyond mere Kristen Clarke, if you look at the left in the Civil Rights Division and the direction in which they were going under Obama, there's an expansion of hate crimes, a stress on hate crimes that could expand it to speech, for example that goes beyond Brandenburg versus Ohio. It's an incitement to say certain things or certain words, express certain concepts, and you may have prosecutions on hate crimes with respect to things you say the wrong way. You know, Trump supporters saying things the wrong way. There may be some hate crime prosecutions there. I'm sure some would like to do that. But take a look at what hate crimes do. CARLSON: That's right. KIRSANOW: Hate crimes, you know, we had a hearing on this where, you know, in 2015, for example, 1.2 million violent crimes in the United States: murders, rapes, robberies, and things of that nature, 821 were hate crimes. In other words, 0.067 percent, it is statistically is likely to be hit by lightning as you are to be the victim of a violent hate crime. But more than that, everything is going to be focused on identity. One of the things that's troubling has to do with crime, and that is that I suspect that we're going to have more Consent Decrees binding the Police Departments in the fashion that was like Chicago and other Police Departments that were subject to consent decrees. What happens then, a magnified Ferguson effect, skyrocketing crime rates. The same with respect to prosecution of individual police officers. Cash bail provisions are going to be attacked, so that people are going to be out on bail or whenever they appear, basically, for their sentencing more crime as a result of that. As you just indicated, more likely than not, they will drop all the lawsuits and investigations related to higher education and the profound, frankly, unlawful under any Supreme Court test, preferences that are given to blacks and Hispanics over whites and Asians that will go into effect. But the dilution of voting integrity provisions is perhaps one of the more troubling aspects of this. That is that, there is going to be an attack on any voting integrity provision so that we have a replication of the kind of, you know, systemic irregularities in voting that we had in the last election. CARLSON: It's just beyond -- this is not the moderate Biden we were promised. Peter Kirsanow, it is great to see you tonight. Thank you. KIRSANOW: Thank you. CARLSON: You may think that government officials wants to get the coronavirus vaccine out to as many people as possible, but that's not true. In one state, hospitals are being punished for distributing the vaccine. We'll tell you why, next. CARLSON: You might have concluded that our elected leaders want to distribute the coronavirus vaccine, but you'd be mistaken, at least in New York. According to New York City's Mayor Bill de Blasio, the state's Emmy Award winning governor is pushing hospitals, punishing hospitals rather for distributing the vaccine. ( BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO (D), NEW YORK CITY: Here's the problem. I mean, as I understand some breaking news just now that the City of New Rochelle, which obviously was in the epicenter of the beginning of the crisis, they just proceeded to vaccinate first responders and essential workers and the State of New York announced that they are fining that city and taking away their vaccine, which is punitive, which is counterproductive, which is stopping vaccines from actually being used. ( END AUDIO CLIP) CARLSON: Now this might make sense to you because the elderly should get the vaccine first no matter what, we have more bad news. New York officials aren't allowed to give the vaccine to people over the age of 75, those people who need it most and they can't get it. ( BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) DE BLASIO: I have to acknowledge the State of New York will not legally allow us to vaccinate New Yorkers over 75 who are vulnerable nor essential workers, and we're just going to be ready on the assumption that the public outcry and the sheer facts and what our healthcare leaders are saying are finally going to break through to the state and that they're going to allow us to do this. ( END AUDIO CLIP) CARLSON: What the heck is going on? Dr. Marc Siegel is the man we go to, to answer questions like that. He's our FOX News medical contributor. Doctor, thanks for coming on. What is this? Is this true? DR. MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR: It's true, Tucker. Now look, back in 1947, there was a single case of smallpox in New York City and you know what happened? With glass syringes, the city ramped up and vaccinated six million people in less than a month. You know what the difference between 1947 and now? One word, ""regulations."" Here, now, we've got regulations. We've got a vaccine that everybody needs, but we've got a governor battling with a mayor, and as you just pointed out, the governor is fining people if they get the vaccine and they shouldn't or fining hospitals, potentially, if doses are thrown out because a narrow group isn't targeted. I'm wondering, by the way, and that's under Group 1A, I'm wondering if there's extra vaccine at the end of the day, why not give it to the person who is willing, a person down the hall on a stretcher? Why not give it to people in the gift shop? Why not give it to people that are cooking meals or an older person in room one who might be 76 years old that would really need this vaccine? So now, the governor, by the way, today under pressure, he is saying, okay, we're going to expand to Group 1B, and 1B, Tucker includes everybody over the age of 75. Well, I'm getting millions of calls today saying, ""It's my turn. It's my turn, Doc. Can I have it tomorrow?"" Except they didn't look at the fine print, Tucker, because there's one word there that the governor added. He said, you can register now. You can register now. He also said, he is calling it Matilda's Rule. After his 89-year-old dear mother, Matilda Cuomo. He says, my mother, my dear mother may not actually get this vaccine. She can register. It may take 14 weeks before Matilda Cuomo qualifies for this vaccine. We've got to give it to all these frontline healthcare workers first, everyone in nursing homes. And finally, by mid-April, we might have enough vaccines for the elderly. But I have a question for you, Tucker, to end. Do you think the governor's mother is going to wait until mid-April, Tucker? CARLSON: No. No, I don't. I mean, is she? No, of course. I mean, no. No vulnerable peoples who are connected to anyone in power wait for anything, of course. That's how the country is built. Doctor, thank you. Great to see you. SIEGEL: Thank you, Tucker. CARLSON: It's been an amazing day. Just in the past hour, we have seen -- we're going to say it again, an unprecedented crackdown on the most basic civil liberties we've enjoyed for 200 years in this country; and the first and it's in the First Amendment is the freedom of speech. They have pushed us into our own isolated little worlds out of COVID restrictions, made us more dependent on social media to communicate with each other and then crack down on our use of social media. It can't end well. Have a great night. We'll be back Monday. Have a wonderful weekend with the ones you love. Sean Hannity takes over. Classification"
2021-01-27,"TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. Happy Wednesday. Well, it looks like this is the part of the revolution where they start throwing their political opponents in jail. Wow, that was fast. It was just a week ago they were telling us about unity. Remember that? What we didn't know at the time is they meant that everyone with power should unite against the rest of the country. Unity meant oligarchy. Oh, Doug Mackey learned that the hard way this morning. Mackey is a 31- year-old conservative journalist from Florida. At 7:00 a.m. F.B.I. showed up at Mackey's house, they threw him in handcuffs and dragged him to his cell. He now faces 10 years in prison. His crime: he made fun of powerful Democrats on social media. As the Federal criminal complaint puts it, quote: ""Mackey made coordinated use of social media to spread disinformation relevant to the impending 2016 presidential election."" This disinformation in the Biden administration solemnly explained, quote: "" ... often took the form of memes."" Yes, memes: online mockery. Mockery online is now illegal when it's aimed at the wrong people. Doug Mackey hurt their feelings, so they put him in jail. According to Joe Biden's Justice Department, Doug Mackey violated 18 U.S. Code Section 241. He did this by tricking people like the dastardly trickster that he is into not voting in the presidential election. What's interesting is that prosecutors showed no evidence whatsoever that Doug Mackey actually tricked anyone into anything voting or not, not a single person. But that doesn't matter shrieked CNN, Doug Mackey is a bad person with bad views. And by the way, we have no idea what Doug Mackey's views are. We don't care. What CNN is telling us is that those views are a crime. He is a criminal. Lock him up. Give him a longer sentence than we give to rapists -- which they're trying to do. As of tonight, that is the official position of the lynch mob channel. But hold on a minute, as a legal matter, have you ever read 18 U.S. Code Section 241? Probably not. But you should. Look it up. When you read it, you will learn that Joe Biden's Justice Department is lying in a very obvious way and that should make you very nervous. It turns out that Federal law does not ban memes or for that matter, misinformation, whatever that is. The law that Biden's prosecutors are citing instead prohibits, quote: ""Conspiring to injure, oppress, threaten or intimidate anyone from exercising the right to vote."" According to the law that would include kidnapping voters, invading their homes, sexually abusing them. Doug Mackey didn't do any of that -- not even close to any of that. Doug Mackey made memes, therefore, he's a domestic terrorist. Speech is violence, dissent is a felony. What you may be wondering does a case like this mean for the First Amendment? Well, it means that it's effectively suspended. You can now be arrested for saying the wrong things and at 7:00 a.m. this morning, one journalist actually was arrested for that. Almost no one tonight seems to be defending him. He had bad thoughts. He deserves it. They think it's okay, and that shouldn't surprise you because we're clearly living under some form of Martial Law at the moment. How do we know that? Well, here's one indication. There are nearly 10,000 Federal troops in our capital city tonight. Oh, that's a hint. Why are they there? How long will they be staying? Nobody is being very specific about any of that, so you're left to draw your own conclusions, which people naturally are. And by the way, it's not making anyone more moderate. If you're really worried about extremism, you probably wouldn't put 10,000 Federal troops in your capital city, making everyone more radical and crazy. But they don't care about that. The point of this whole highly militarized exercise is to remind you of what Chairman Mao once famously said: political power grows from the barrel of a gun. Unfortunately, that is true in every country at all times. Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy is no genius, but he does understand that. As he explained today, as long as his political opponents exist, those soldiers will stay. SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT): The threat to the country is not over. Right? We still have 5,000 National Guard members surrounding the Capitol Complex. Why? Because there are still existing threats, present threats to the security of the Capitol. And so, so long as Donald Trump is empowered by Senate Republicans, there is still the chance that he is going to incite another attempt at the Capitol. The threat is still very real to American democracy. CARLSON: Okay, so as long as there are people in this country who persist in disagreeing with Chris Murphy, explains Chris Murphy, we're going to need to keep thousands of heavily armed soldiers on the scene. Why specifically? Because -- and we're quoting now, ""The threat is still very real to American democracy."" But wait, democracy requires soldiers? We thought it was voluntary. If you're starting to think that maybe someone at some point secretly redefined the term democracy, changing its meaning to roughly 180 degrees from what it was just last year, you may be onto something. What we're looking at now is not democracy in the classical Athenian sense, where everyone gets to vote and the voice of everyone matters equally. No, what we are looking at now is instead democracy in the 1970s Eastern Bloc People's Democratic Republic sense. This new version of democracy is a democracy where everyone fervently agrees with the people in power, or else they go immediately to jail. Doug Mackey's problem, it turns out, is that he didn't properly understand what democracy is. Thankfully, Congressman Tim Ryan of Ohio does understand it and he explained it to us today. ""We're not letting those soldiers go home,"" Tim Ryan said, until they do what our special operations forces did in Iraq and Afghanistan. Watch this. REP. TIM RYAN (D-OH): Who in our government, in our military have had experience around crowd control, maybe even Special Operations Forces in Iraq and Afghanistan? Like, how can we learn everything we need to learn to reset the posture on Capitol Hill? And we're not going to let the National Guard go home or we're not going to create an unsafe environment for the country's business until we have that figured out. CARLSON: Oh, they are specialists in controlling unruly populations. We get it. Rather than answer our questions or improve our lives, you're bringing in people with guns to remind us that you're in charge and dissent is illegal. That's a big change. You may have thought you were a decent American in good standing. Ten years ago, nobody in this country would have called your views extreme. They weren't extreme then. You don't think they're extreme now? You've always considered myself a pretty moderate person: live your life and get along with others. Oh, that's not possible now, because the rules have changed. You are now a dangerous insurgent. You are no different from a bloodthirsty Pashtun in Helmand Province or an ISIS terrorist in Erbil. You're part of a guerrilla insurgency. Maybe it's a gorilla insurgency. That's possible, too. Have you seen the pictures from January 6th? Some of those terror leaders seems suspiciously furry. Here's the mastermind behind that terrible insurrection. The jihadi known by his nom de guerre Chewbacca guy. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey. [Bleep] man. Glad to see you guys. You guys are patriots. Look at this guy, he has got -- he is covered in blood. God bless you. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You good, sir? You need medical attention. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm good. Thank you. I got shot in the face. I got shot in the face with some kind of plastic bullet. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Any chance I could you get you guys to leave the Senate wing? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We will. I've been making sure they ain't disrespecting the place. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Okay, I just want to let you guys know this is like the sacredest place. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I know. CARLSON: Sad news tonight. Chewbacca guy is no longer available for your kid's seventh birthday party. He is in prison tonight. We will tell you when they move them to Gitmo or some undisclosed black site. And when they do, Sandy Cortez will breathe easier. Back during the Great Terrorist Siege of January 6th, Sandy Cortez found herself in the same city as Chewbacca, literally in the same city, trapped and abandoned. Just like those lonely valiant troops in Corregidor so many years ago. She really thought she was going to die. REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): I had a pretty traumatizing event happen to me. I can tell you that I had a very close encounter where I thought I was going to die. CARLSON: So thankfully, they've arrested Chewbacca guy and the rest of his marauding band of terrorists, many of them well over 65 years old. So there is still a little justice in this country. But hairy stoners in Viking hats are not the only threat that Sandy Cortez faces tonight. No, far from it. There are the other Members of Congress to worry about, some of them are Republicans, and you know what that means. At any moment, these people are likely to open fire indiscriminately on the House floor purely out of racism. And of course, she's worried about that. Listen. CORTEZ: We still don't yet feel safe around other Members of Congress. CHRIS CUOMO, CNN ANCHOR: How many -- CORTEZ: I think a very considerable amount. The moment you bring a gun onto the House floor in violation of rules, you put everyone around you in danger. I don't care if you accidentally set it off. I don't care if you intentionally set it off. I don't care if you set it off at all. You are putting -- you are endangering the lives of Members of Congress. And it is absolutely outrageous that we even have to have this conversation. CARLSON: It's outrageous. Absolutely outrageous, said the leader of America's narcissism party, the fastest growing party in the country. Even on the House floor surrounded by other elected Members of Congress, democratically elected -- Sandy Cortez did not feel safe. And that, my friends is why we need tens of thousands of armed Federal troops right outside her office tonight, so that Sandy Cortez can finally for once take a breath and get back to the vital business of making perky Instagram videos about herself. The business of the people. It must go on. Well, of course it must. We all support that. Now that we're talking about the people, you've got to wonder what they think of all of this, the actual people. No one in power cares what they think, obviously. None of this is about the people who are actually suffering in our country, the millions of them. No, we're watching one of those rare revolutions, rare in world history that's being waged, not on behalf of the general population, but waged against it. All of this is being done expressly for the oligarchs. None of it is being done for you. Of course, if you live in Washington, D.C., you already know that very well. Federal troops are not protecting your home tonight. Sandy Cortez doesn't care if you get robbed or carjacked, as more and more people are as crime skyrockets. Sandy Cortez and her friends want to abolish your police, not their police. Here's a scene from the rest of the City of Washington.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice over): Carmelo Duncan was 15 months old when he was fatally shot Wednesday night in the Southeast. His father was driving the vehicle and the toddler was strapped into his car seat when he was struck with bullets. A preliminary investigation pointed out at least two people opened fire on the car as he drove by Southern Ave., hitting the car at least 10 times. CARLSON: The toddler was struck with bullets in his car seat right next to his father. This happened in Washington, D.C. within walking distance of the Capitol, but no one inside that domed building, the ones who are so afraid of Chewbacca man noticed or cared. So whatever else you conclude from this, this tale of two cities -- to dip into the cliche bin for a moment -- here's one thing you can be certain of. It's not actually violence that Sandy Cortez and her fellow Democrats are worried about. No, it's something else. So why are all those Federal troops at the Capitol? Mark Steyn joins us in just a minute to assess that. But first, Congressman Thomas Massie, a Member of Congress, joins us with his guess. Congressman, I really appreciate your coming on tonight. So clearly, it's not about violence. You go to Washington, you work in Washington, the city is consumed by violence. The crime rate has gone up ever since the George Floyd riots started and nobody cares, the police are nowhere to be found. What are these troops really about do you think? REP. THOMAS MASSIE (R-KY): That's a good question, and before I touch that, I want to remind people that what I'm about to say is not meant to be critical of the troops, or of the Capitol Hill Police. But what -- you know, what people might be mistaking -- mistakenly thinking is going on here is that Congress is doing the two things that they do well, which is to do nothing, and then to overreact. CARLSON: Right. MASSIE: To basically not provide for protection, and then to show up with 26,000 troops. But that is not what's going on here. It's much more insidious than that. They are using the soldiers as a pretext for three things in Washington, D.C. right now. Number one, they've promised that the soldiers will be there during the impeachment trial. You see, the impeachment trial in the Senate is unconstitutional. But unless they give you the impression that Donald Trump created something that's still going on, then there's no reason to have an impeachment trial, so they want the soldiers there for that. The other thing that's going on, some of my Democratic colleagues want to expel Republican members in the House and the Senate for merely objecting to things on the House floor. They're saying they are seditionists. And so by projecting this image of the Capitol under siege by, quote, ""domestic terrorists,"" they're keeping that agenda alive. But the most insidious thing -- the reason that they have these soldiers here, Tucker, is that they want to pass new laws that will invade your privacy, confiscate your guns in the name of domestic terrorism. They're trying to project this image. And my colleagues aren't stupid. They know that images are more powerful than any words they could say on the Senate floor or the House floor. They're trying to project an image that we are under siege, that the country is under siege from an ever present danger of domestic terrorism. But here's what's ridiculous. Their definition of domestic terrorism is so broad now that it includes the actual Guardsmen who are there to protect them. My colleagues whip themselves into a state of fear and paranoia. CARLSON: Very quickly. I know a lot of your colleagues in the Republican Conference are for the troops, but they want to send them, to you know, invade Iran or whatever. Why has nobody stood up and made the obvious point? This is about political power. The troops in our country's capital, please make them leave immediately. Why aren't Republicans saying that? MASSIE: Well, this may be the next forever war. Look, the 9/11 was used as the pretext to grab civil liberties and to deploy troops around the globe. They're still not back and they do need to come back. But now we've got more troops deployed in our nation's capital than we do those two countries. CARLSON: Yes, this is grotesque. And I appreciate you. Finding a Member of Congress to say this as clearly as you did was not easy, and so I'm grateful that you came to say what you said. Congressman Massie, thank you. Thomas Massie of Kentucky. MASSIE: Thank you, Tucker. CARLSON: Mark Steyn is a bestselling author, one of the smartest men we know, joining us now with a reaction to this. So Mark, you've spent your entire life as a journalist mocking people, people you disagree with politically. Here you have Doug Mackey, who I'd never heard of before today, is a journalist, he mocks people. He is going to jail for it. How do you feel about that? MARK STEYN, AUTHOR AND COLUMNIST: Well, disgusted. I mean, it's extraordinary to me that the F.B.I., which are the guys who interfered in the 2016 election, now, terrorizing some guy who posted a picture of Taylor Swift wearing a MAGA hat that he had PhotoShopped onto her head. So in other words, all the dirty rotten, stinking corrupt officials of the Department of Justice and at the F.B.I., both of which I think are actually irredeemable now and should probably be disbanded and rebuilt from scratch. The guys who actually interfered in the 2016 election, and got their buddies in MI-6 and ASIO in Australia to assist them setting up Papadopoulos and the rest of the crowd, they now found some little fella to make an example of and they're going to stick him in jail for 10 years. And the F.B.I. agent, our pal, Sean Hannity has always gone on about all the good people in the F.B.I., I'm sorry, Sean, but the F.B.I. agent who investigated this guy, for a non-crime should be ashamed of herself, and actually shouldn't have taken that gig. CARLSON: I totally agree. Now, they're telling us about this threat of domestic extremism, and I'm trying to be as honest and as clear thinking as I can be. I'm starting to agree with them. I think a crackdown like this will create extremism. I think they know that, and if they don't know it, they are deeply unwise. But arresting people for memes, banning whole social media sites, a crackdown like this cannot help but create domestic extremism. Do they not see that? STEYN: Well, they think they can handle that. If you recall, George Orwell in 1984. They invented a forever war going on, on the far fringes of the map. In this case, they are actually being more ambitious, they invent -- I've lived in countries with domestic terrorism movements. That's not what's going on here. Here, we've got a theater. I don't know why you need real troops to do what these guys are doing in Washington. Everyone on Broadway is currently unemployed at the moment. So you can easily get you know, the chorus from ""Hello, Dolly"" to dress up as soldiers and do what they're doing here. They're inventing a domestic insurgency that does not exist. CARLSON: So I've got my producers who are watching other channels as our show happens, because there's just so much going on now. Apparently, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez -- Sandy Cortez is on another channel right now saying and I think I'm quoting, ""There are white nationalists, white supremacist -- sympathizers at the heart of the G.O.P. caucus in Washington among elected officials,"" and that Kevin McCarthy takes his marching orders from QAnon -- whatever that is. STEYN: Right. CARLSON: Where is this going? I mean, this is a sitting Member of Congress accusing other Members of Congress of being terrorists. What? What's the plan here? STEYN: Yes. Basically, they are reverse engineering the Republican Party to make the guy in the Viking hat, the guy controlling it all. You know, he could be an Afghan goat herd, Pashtun goat herd, could be a Taliban guy who has secretly taken over the Republican Party. We are in a blizzard of lies, the audacity and absurdity of which is unprecedented. CARLSON: This is starting to worry me. Mark Steyn, great to see you. Thank you. STEYN: Thanks a lot, Tucker. CARLSON: Well, you remember the first time you heard the phrase ""defund the police."" You thought that's so far out. So obviously, unwise and destructive that will so clearly lead to the deaths of Americans. It could never become mainstream. Thanks to promotion on social media of people like Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez, it did become mainstream. How did that happen so fast? We will tell you straight ahead. CARLSON: All of a sudden, some of the richest people in the country have come out in support of positions that will destroy the country, obviously. Things like defunding the police or opening the borders, things you would never do if you cared about the country, or the people who live here. We know for a fact these policies will have no effect on those who support them. They're walled off from their effects. Instead, they will hurt the people they're supposedly intended to help. This happened so many times. So why are the greatest beneficiaries of our system, still pushing policies that will destroy the system? Our next guest has thought a lot about this. He calls his positions ""luxury beliefs."" Author and former Air Force veteran Rob Henderson joins us. Hey, Rob, thanks so much for coming on. ROB HENDERSON, AUTHOR: Thank you, Tucker. Good to be here. CARLSON: So define for us, if you would. There's something going on here. I think most people feel it. I think you put a finer point on it that I've seen before, what's a luxury belief? HENDERSON: Right. So luxury beliefs are a new way of understanding the American status system. So in the past, upper class people would display their social positions with expensive clothes or jewelry or material displays. But today, they do it through luxury beliefs, which are defined as ideas and opinions that confer status on the upper class while inflicting costs on the lower classes. CARLSON: Right. That's an inversion of what we saw during the last Gilded Age a hundred odd years ago, where the affluent made a great show of helping the poor, and in some cases actually did help them. You know, your rich guy's wife starts the orphan's home. Now the rich guy's wife tries to destroy the country. What is that about? HENDERSON: Well, one thing that's driving this is desire for social status. So there's some interesting research, for example, showing that the people who occupy the highest positions in society with the most wealth and the most education, they tend to care the most about social status, which is perhaps a little counterintuitive. You might think that people without much in the way of means would care a lot about sort of wealth and status and those kinds of things, but it's actually the people at the top who have status, who wants even more of it. And today, luxury beliefs are the way to do that, expressing these sort of unusual or unconventional beliefs that sort of raise their positions among their peers in society. They're trying to impress those around them, more so than trying to help the Americans who need it the most. CARLSON: So the richest people care the most about their status, and the sort of silly markers for status, like your fashionable opinions. That's so interesting and unexpected, I never would have thought that. I appreciate your coming on tonight, Rob. That's smart as hell and clear. Thank you. HENDERSON: Thank you. CARLSON: Anyone who really cares about silly status symbols like that is an idiot and should have no power, obviously. So if you've thought all the science and vaccine developments meant that your kids could go back to school and not remain ignorant or be destroyed by the isolation they've been enduring for the last year, no, the teachers unions are in charge and they're showing you that through interpretive dance. That's straight ahead. CARLSON: Not many of our leaders have remained consistent during the scope of this coronavirus pandemic, but there is one exception to that: teachers unions. No matter what else may change in the science, their position remains unchanging. We don't want to work -- at all. Keep paying us, we're not working. The President of Fairfax County Teachers Union, that's one of the largest teachers' unions in the world is so committed to not working that she has called for teachers to stay home even after they've been vaccinated for the coronavirus, which, by the way -- the children they teach. Tonight in Loudoun County, Virginia, one parent said what every other parent in this country has thought -- this is insane, it is killing our children. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're a bunch of cowards, hiding behind our children as an excuse for keeping schools closed. You think you're some sort of martyrs because of the decisions you're making when the statistics do not lie that the vast majority of the population is not at risk from this virus. The garbage workers who pick up my freaking trash risk their lives every day, more than anyone in this school system. Figure it out or get off the podium, because you know what? There are people like me and a lot of other people out there who will gladly take your seat and figure it out. It's not a high bar, raise the frickin' bar. CARLSON: Ah, you can feel the emotion and you know where it comes from? That man and so many other parents have been home with their own kids for the better part of a year. Watching their kids learn nothing, become even more addicted to screens, become totally isolated from other kids. Watching them degrade and suffer. Why? So their teachers can avoid a virus that has virtually no effect on children. They're not going to get from the kids they teach. It's criminal. It's totally wrong. In Clark County, Nevada, for example, a warning system that monitors students mental health episodes has issued over 3,000 alerts to district officials about students' suicidal thoughts, possible self-harm, or cries for care. That is clinical language for kids who are being crushed by this. A total of 18 students just in Clark County have killed themselves since the lockdowns began. But we're told the teachers unions need to stay home. It's just too dangerous for them. What cowards they are. What's more important, their health or the health of the children they teach? Our children. Our country's children. By the way, everyone else is going to work: delivery men, grocery store workers, the people who bring you your sushi from Uber Eats. How many these teachers are going to grocery stores by the way? How many of them are going on vacation? All of them. We know that one executive of the teachers union in Chicago, a woman called Sarah Chambers, remember that name -- was vacationing in the Caribbean last month and bragging about it on social media. How many teachers are doing that? That seems like a good question. But instead of answering that question, the Chicago's Teachers Union has decided to produce an interpretive dance video. This is totally real. It seems like right-wing propaganda, but it's totally real. This is the same union that voted to stay home in defiance of the city's reopening plan. Here's their message. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Make it make sense. Safety is essential. Keep our students and our teachers safe. It's our livelihood. CARLSON: Joe Biden could fix this with a phone call. He could save kids in this country. Who goes to Chicago Public Schools? Rich kids? No, they go to Francis Parker. It's poor kids, and Joe Biden could save them and we would praise him for doing that because we're not partisan, actually. But no. They're doing the opposite. The Biden demonstration is praising the Chicago Teachers Union. Those teachers are the future of this country, Joe Biden tells us. They're not scientists, of course, and neither are they good dancers. But they are huge donors to the Democratic Party. Joe Biden is not going to criticize them. In the last election cycle, teachers unions donated more than $4 million to the Democratic Party candidates in Congress. They gave fewer than 50 grand to Republicans. Of course, this isn't about money, it is about science. But science, unlike the teachers unions, has changed quite a bit during this pandemic. Now science is telling us we need to wear two masks instead of just one. In fact, experts on other networks says yes, we might need to wear three masks just to be safe. Think of it like triple bagging your face, it's the only way to be safe. DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: So if you have a physical covering with one layer, you put another layer on, it just makes common sense that it likely would be more effective. And that's the reason why you see people either double masking or doing a version of an N95. CARLSON: So double masking is now just commonsense, it is just commonsense. How long are people going to put up with this? Follow the logic. Would it just be safer at this point for people just to stop breathing entirely? You wouldn't get COVID. You get the impression that's kind of where Tony Fauci may be a few months from now. Back in March before he was allowed to appear on MSNBC primetime shows, Tony Fauci wasn't just opposed to double masking. He was opposed to any masking. To masks, remember? FAUCI: Right now in the United States, people should not be walking around with masks. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're sure of it, because people are listening really closely to this. FAUCI: Right now, people should not be worried. There's no reason to be walking around with a mask. When you're in the middle of an outbreak, wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better, and it might even block a droplet, but it is not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is. CARLSON: This guy is a malignant buffoon. He is. And the teachers unions are actively hurting children. They are. Why are we listening to any of these people? Miranda Devine is a columnist with ""The New York Post."" She joins us tonight. Why are we listening to these people? How much authority do they have left, would you say, Miranda? MIRANDA DEVINE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I'm sorry, but with Tony Fauci, I am not going to listen to a man who admitted that he lied to us about the efficacy of masks the early time of the pandemic, when it might have made a difference, might have saved some lives. I'm not listening to someone who told us blithely to go off and catch a cruise in March during the pandemic or in fact who argued vociferously with the President then Trump about stopping flights from Wuhan, China on January 31st. So he doesn't have any authority, moral or scientific as far as I'm concerned. I'm not going to listen to him about double or triple masking. What he should be doing is he should be saying loud and clear to Joe Biden and the teacher unions that the number one psychological risk we have at the moment is to a generation of children, millions of children who are in misery at the moment. They, as you said, are committing suicide. They are in all sorts of trouble. And Tony Fauci should be telling us what the science is because we know what the science is. It is that children do not pass on the virus to their teachers. In fact, they get less infected than their parents, they are not a risk. And these teachers are the only -- it is the only line of work where you can sit at home and not go to work and still get paid. It is pathological. That video you showed up, those people prancing around, that is sociopathic to be doing that when children are committing suicide because they can't go to school. They're trapped. And we are just betraying their futures, throwing them away, and Joe Biden has this unique ability to connect with the teacher unions because he is the teacher, Union guy. He's the union guy. And he has the political capital at the moment because he is not Donald Trump to -- he just won an election. He could actually go to those unions, who will listen to him because he does have that moral authority from his union background and tell them that they should stop scaremongering, listen to the science that he tells us is so important, understand that they are not going to get sick from their students, and that they need to go back to work. And, frankly, you know, to be pretending that you're not going to go back to work until all the children are vaccinated, as well as all the teachers is just a fraud because we know that the vaccine is not approved yet for children, and children are not at risk. So go back to school now and look after the children that you are entrusted to look after, or otherwise, just quit and let somebody else get in and do those jobs. I'm sure, you know, you could get any person on the street could walk in and teach those kids better. CARLSON: I honestly think if Trump had run on this, he would have won, just my view -- because people care about their kids and the kids are being really hurt. That's real. Miranda, I appreciate your coming on tonight. Thank you. DEVINE: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: Well, there's a war going on between hedge funds and the most powerful institutions in the world and a group of anonymous people on Twitter, rather on the internet, and for now, those anonymous people on the internet seem to be winning. It's a huge story with massive implications for our economy. Charles Payne joins us after the break to explain what's going on and what it means. CARLSON: Hedge funds do a lot of things to make money, but one of those things is trading in the options market, shorting companies, in other words making money when the stock price of other companies -- some of these American companies -- go down. They lose money, hedge funds make money. That's part of the business model, shorting stocks. So borrowing shares and selling them on the expectation that those shares will decline in value. Well, for the past several months, hedge funds have shorted the stock of a retailer called GameStop. People online watched this. This kind of stuff happens all the time. And by the way, sometimes hedge fund managers go on television, we've talked about this before on the show, and attack specific companies or whole sectors of the economy hoping the value will go down and they can profit from it. That's pretty ugly -- very ugly. It's very wrong. It's apparently legal though. So people have watched all this and ultimately they decided to act. A group of people on Reddit decided to buy up GameStop options and that triggered a chain reaction that drove GameStop share price higher and higher and higher. As of today, shares of GameStop are up 1,700 percent since the beginning of the month. That means people on Reddit profited, people in hedge funds were betting that share price would down lost money, and that's a crime. Only people who work for hedge funds are allowed to manipulate the market often with the help of CNBC. Normal people are not allowed to do that. Already, the people in charge of our system are outraged that anyone without an official position at a hedge fund would dare manipulate the market to their benefit. The communications platform Discord has taken action against this. They have shut down the day traders claiming that they're committing hate speech. In other words, if you do what hedge funds do, but you don't work at a hedge fund, you're a racist. Obviously. It's just the beginning. Today, the CEO of NASDAQ jumped to the hedge funds rescue and suggested that day trading would need to be halted. ADENA FRIEDMAN, CEO, NASDAQ: I think we see a significant rise in the chatter on social media channels, and then we also match that up against unusual trading activity, we will potentially halt that stock to allow ourselves to investigate the situation to be able to engage with the company and to give investors a chance to recalibrate their positions. CARLSON: So this seems like a really big and significant story. This is not a financial show that we're not fluent really in this stuff, Charles Payne is. He is host of ""Making Money"" with Charles Payne at FOX Business and so we're grateful to have him on tonight to explain what is going on and what it means. Charles, thanks for coming on. CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST, ""MAKING MONEY"": Tucker, you hit a whole lot of it. But let me just fill it in a little bit more, because not only are these folks -- these hedge funds selling the stock, they don't own the stock. So they borrow it. Imagine you borrow a stock that's trading at $10.00 and then you drive the share price down and then you buy it back for a dollar. You make the difference -- nine bucks. And to your point, they're allowed to short so much stock, you know, the amount of stock that was out there on GameStop. Let's just say 100 percent of the shares that are out. Well, they shorted 140 percent of that stock. So they borrowed the same stock over and over and over, the same shares, and sold it into the market. Their job, their mission was to drive GameStop to zero -- zero. No one said a word on any financial network, particularly CNBC, which always lets the shorts come on, and a sale go to war with companies, almost voiceless companies. So what happens? Some people get wind of this, these folks that you said or these individual investors, they decide to buy the stock up. They start to pressure the shorts. It's called a short squeeze and it's working and Wall Street is losing its mind. And Wall Street now wants to change the rules of the game, because a bunch of people with accounts ranging from $500.00 to $2,500.00 are taking down the billionaires. CARLSON: Amazing. So, the options, I mean, it's a much longer conversation about how the options market actually helps the real American economy in any way. But unless I'm missing what you're saying, when individual investors tried to do what hedge funds do every day, but to the benefit of GameStop, they are now racist for doing that, and they need to be purged from the internet. PAYNE: Well, you know, in any war, the first thing you want to do is cut off the line of communication. So hence, they are going to be cutting off this Discord, right? They're not going to allow the communication so once you do that, then you start to change other rules of the game. CARLSON: Clearly. Charles Payne, I really appreciate your coming on tonight. Thank you. PAYNE: You've got it, Tucker. Okay. CARLSON: Speaking of cutting off communications, Twitter has now censored another White House official from the last administration. We'll talk to him right here on the one bastion of free speech left in American media, FOX News. We'll be right back. CARLSON: We want to keep track of all of this crackdown on civil liberties in the country, and for that reason, we want to tell you that Twitter has just suspended the account of former White House adviser, Peter Navarro, who joins us now to explain. Peter, why did they do this, do you think? PETER NAVARRO, FORMER WHITE HOUSE ADVISER: They made history today, Tucker, a bad history. I mean, there wasn't anything I said, it's because of who I am and what I might say. And basically the Great Firewall of Silicon Valley grew another few feet today and this is totally unacceptable. If Jack Dorsey came up to me in the public square, ripped out a sign from my hand in a peaceful protest, stomped on it and then muzzled me, he would get arrested. But he can do that now in the Digital Public Square, and I think he does violence to the First Amendment, he did violence today to me, and he does violence to the 74 million people who voted for Donald J. Trump who he is trying to muzzle This This is unacceptable. It's a bridge too far. CARLSON: Did you even get -- in the 15 seconds we have, I wish we had more time -- an explanation for why they did this. NAVARRO: It's something about unusual traffic, but I hadn't tweeted since January 14th. The point here is it's because of who I am and what I might say not because of anything I did and this -- it is Pichai at Google and Dorsey at Twitter, Zuckerberg and Facebook and Bezos and Amazon, they somehow believe that it's their responsibility to shut up half of America. They are doing violence to the First Amendment. They are doing violence to this country. And this will not stand, Tucker. This cannot stand. CARLSON: Protecting the oligarchy, that's their job. Peter Navarro, appreciate your coming on tonight. Thank you. NAVARRO: Thanks for the time, Tucker. CARLSON: Thanks for watching us tonight. The Free Speech Channel, we are proud to be. Sean Hannity takes over now from New York. Classification"
2021-02-11,"TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening. Welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. Happy Thursday. So why are the Democrats so angry? We've asked that question a number of times, it doesn't seem to make any sense truly. In November, the Democratic Party won everything: full control of the Federal government. They ceded for years while they were out of power that made sense but winning seemed to enrage them even more. Did you watch Democrats on television today at the impeachment hearings? They are crazy person mad, florid faced, irrational, yelling and making threats. It is bizarre. You'd think they'd get to work fixing the country they inherited, they promised to do that. Instead, they set about breaking things and hurting people. What is going on here? Well, maybe it is intrinsic. There's a certain sort of low character person who becomes more vicious in victory. Power makes them mean. The Ottomans destroyed the cities they captured, there was never a good reason to do this, to kill people who had already been captured and who had surrendered. The Ottomans did it because they enjoyed it. Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi have a little bit of that in them, it looks like. Imagine being Adam Schiff's landscaper or Nancy Pelosi's housekeeper or anyone at their command? Imagine how they treat the staff when no one is watching. Imagine waiting on them in a restaurant. How would they tip? You know the answer. They're the kind of people who flatter the boss and scream at the interns. They suck up and they spit down. Jeff Bezos is a god to them. You mean nothing. So naturally, the Democratic Party is constructing a world designed to serve Jeff Bezos. You're an afterthought in that world. If you get in the way, they will punish you, they already are punishing you. You're right to say and think what you want, to read and watch what you want, threatens them above all. Why? Because if you have access to information, you can form your own judgments, judgments that are independent of theirs. A free internet is their enemy. The moment they took power, they began to kind of counter-reformation against the free internet. They started the most sweeping mass censorship campaign in the history of this country, and it is accelerating even now. Yesterday, for example, Google pulled a pro-life news site off of YouTube. Why did they do that? Simple. Google supports abortion. A lot of big corporations do. Children distract the labor force. If you're raising your family, you are not serving shareholders. Google doesn't want to debate on the subject, so they just shut the debate down. Hundreds of thousands of subscribers to Lifesite News will no longer be watching videos that question abortion because they're not allowed to. Then today, Twitter shut down James O'Keefe's Project Veritas Twitter feed. There's no justifiable reason to do this, but no one in the media asked questions about it or appeared to consider it a problem. Quote, ""Project Veritas has been known,"" POLITICO announced gravely, "" ... to spread misinformation."" Now, the person who wrote that sentence, a child reporter called Anna, whose Twitter handle brags she went to Cornell, didn't even bother to explain what that so-called misinformation was, but you know what it was. Project Veritas had criticized the people in charge. That's enough now. Anna didn't question that standard, she seemed pleased to play a role in silencing grown up reporters. She thinks that's her job. Good work, Anna. You work at POLITICO now. You get to be America's room monitor and tell the rest of us what to say. How empowering. All the child reporters feel that way. That's why they're in favor of it. So, Project Veritas is off Twitter tonight, but the Red Guards still aren't satisfied. They will not rest until there is not a single human being remaining in all American media who questions any of the platitudes that Anna and her friends memorized at Cornell in lieu of an actual education. Diversity is our strength. Trans rights are human rights. Abortion is healthcare. They don't think about it. They just accept whatever the Central Committee decides is the slogan of the day. And anyone who mocks or disagrees with those slogans is silenced. In the name of diversity, we must have uniformity. With all of the impediments to achieving this goal of uniformity, those would include centuries of tradition, the First Amendment to the Constitution, the fact this was a free country, of all of those, it is this, FOX News that is the most significant hurdle to getting everyone to sing from the same song sheet. FOX is the last big organization in the American news media that differs in even the smallest ways from the other big news organizations, the only one. That's it. Just us. At this point, there's everyone else in the media standing in crisp formation in their starched matching uniforms and their little caps, patiently awaiting orders from the billionaire class, and then there's FOX News off by itself occasionally saying things that are slightly different from everyone else. On FOX, there are journalists who are willing to think for themselves sometimes and brave enough to say so out loud. It seems like that's what journalism should be. But in 2021, it's a very rare thing, and the oligarchs hate it. Jeff Bezos, for one has had enough of it. Bezos has sent forth his personal scribes from ""The Washington Post"" to make us go away, to end FOX News. On command, they've written a number of columns suggesting that FOX News must be silenced. They've gone on television to demand that FOX News is silenced. Here's one of Jeff Bezos' employees. MAX BOOT, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: There are other options, including the fact that cable operators like Comcast and Charter which send FOX out to hundreds of millions of people, they can demand some accountability in the way that Facebook and Twitter have done. And there is, also I think, the possibility of reviving the Fairness Doctrine. CARLSON: There are a lot of ways to silence FOX News, he has explained on television and in columns, but he doesn't call it silencing FOX News. He says, ""We must demand some accountability."" In other words, make it go away. Get in line. No more unauthorized questions. No more criticizing Jeff Bezos. And he is not the only one saying it. In the last 30 days, a single columnist at ""The New York Times"" called Nick Kristof has written three separate columns demanding that someone please yank this news off the air immediately. Just yesterday, Kristof suggested that this show, the one you're watching was somehow guilty of terrorism, of violence, something that we've been opposed consistently for four years. How are we guilty of that and why? Well, because Ashli Babbitt, the unarmed protesters shot to death at the Capitol on January 6th, apparently watch this show from time to time at 8:00 p.m. Now keep in mind that Ashli Babbitt is dead. She paid quite a price for trying to enter the Speaker's lobby without permission, and no one more -- what kind of country is it by the way -- and we're saying this as a show that was against what they did on January 6th from the second they did it. But what kind of country is it where nobody says, well, wait, that's kind of sad. They shot an unarmed woman? Is that really a death penalty offense? How hardhearted are we that no one can even acknowledge that is sad, which it is. What kind of country is it where a Republican Member of Congress from Oklahoma applauded her death immediately? Nick Kristof is applauding it. But for Nick Kristof, her death is not enough. Now we need to ban any television shows that Ashli Babbitt may have watched. We're not even going to rebut that. It's not even worth your time to hear us explain why that is irrational. It's self-evidently irrational. Pol Pot reads ""The New York Times"" therefore, we need to close the paper down? John Wayne Gacy liked the Nick Kristoff column, therefore, Nick Kristoff is guilty of mass murder. He's a serial killer, too? That's what Nick Kristoff is saying. We would never say something like that. Ever. It's too stupid. But nothing is too stupid for Nick Kristof or ""The New York Times."" What Kristof lacks in reason, he makes up for with vehemence. Nick Kristof, in the end cannot stand the idea that someone somewhere might be publicly disagreeing with him, so he is calling for forcible censorship. What would be nice is if he just said it out loud, yes, I'm calling for censorship. Be a man about it and admit what you're doing. But of course, he will never do that. These are not men. These are craven servants of the Democratic Party. They are feline, not canine. All of their aggression is passive aggression. Watch another slope shoulder tool of the oligarchy feign outrage that we have called censorship what it is -- censorship. Oh, but it's not censorship, he whines, it's harm reduction. BRIAN STELTER, CNN CHIEF MEDIA CORRESPONDENT: And Tucker Carlson is telling viewers that this network, CNN is trying to force FOX News off the air, which is patently false. But while some call it cancel culture, let me suggest a different way to think about this, a harm reduction model. By reducing a liar's reach is not the same as censoring freedom of speech. Freedom of speech is different than freedom of reach. CARLSON: Oh, ""Let me suggest a different model, the harm reduction model."" Notice the seductively imprecise language of personal therapy. We're all AOC now. It's all about us. It's not a fascist crackdown on free speech by ruthless and empowered mad billionaires. No, not at all. It's just harm reduction, like methadone or Nicorette. It's a way to get better. When they come for you, they will talk like social workers. Guaranteed. Sean Davis helped found ""The Federalist"" he knows what this is about. They've come for him. He joins us tonight. Sean, thanks so much for coming on. I never want to sound like we are complaining and you know, we hate talking about the show on the show. However, in the last several weeks, and particularly in the last 24 hours, the call to take this show off the air by groups funded -- for real -- by the Ford Foundation or by George Soros, by Michael Bloomberg, by Jeff Bezos has become deafening going after advertisers, going after the companies that carry our signal into your home. What is this about? It's not just about us. But what is it about, do you think? The censorship? SEAN DAVIS, ""THE FEDERALIST"": Yes, I think it's about the complete totalitarian takeover of the left in America in 2020 and 2021. And it used to be that there was an authoritarian strain on the left, they wanted to control what you do. You know, put a mask on. Don't do this. You must do that. Totalitarianism is a lot worse and a lot more sinister. They want to control what you say and they want to control what you think. And they do that because they think they should have total control over everything. And eventually, as we learned in Orwell's 1984, eventually, when they start banning words they don't like, they'll eventually start banding thoughts they don't like. In 1984, Orwell wrote, ""The revolution will be complete when the language is perfect."" This is all about controlling language, to eventually control thoughts to eliminate ways of expressing things they don't think you should be thinking. It's as simple as that. CARLSON: I just can't believe the cowardice and the complicity of the entire media class in all of this. At some point, the revolution is going to end, and the kids at POLITICO and ""The Daily Beast"" and CNN and NBC are going to be standing there and someone is going to ask them, you know, why didn't you say something as they hurt people for saying what they thought was true? And what are they going to say, do you think? DAVIS: Oh, they'll pretend it was somebody else's fault. This is what they all do. And the thing is that, we grew up at a time where if you were arguing with someone on the playground and they didn't like what you were saying, and told you to shut up, you'd say this is a free country, I can say whatever I want. I'm not sure kids say that on the schoolyard anymore. And the thing about speech is, it's important as an end, just to be able to speak our thoughts. But it's also important as a means because speech is the pressure release valve that we have as a society. CARLSON: That's right. DAVIS: When people can argue things, when people can talk, they can avoid taking other measures. And the more they throttle speech, the more they are bringing about the violence which they swear they actually oppose. CARLSON: How ironic for, you know, anyone familiar with American history that extends back, you know, I guess before November, that ""The New York Times,"" which won the most famous free speech case in American history is leading the charge against the First Amendment, firing its own employees for having the wrong beliefs, trying to shut down FOX News. I mean, did you ever think you would live to see that? DAVIS: It's shocking, I mean, especially with the guilt by association. If a bad person watched this thing, we must cancel that thing. This is the paper that published Hitler. This is the paper that ran interference for Stalin and for the Soviets, and for them, given their history to do this is obscene. CARLSON: Yes, that got us into the Iraq War, in which so many Americans were killed, injured or impoverished. Yes, you're right. Sean Davis, great to see you. Thank you. DAVIS: Thank you. CARLSON: So there's a lot going on in the country, but people who want to live like we live maybe three years ago tend to be moving to a small number of states, Florida is one of those states, one of the free states left. And because of that, the new Biden administration is seeking to punish for it. No administration has ever suggested anything like this. Florida Senator Marco Rubio joins us to explain what's happening and what he plans to do about it after the break. CARLSON: The country is a lot less free than it used to be, but some states are trying hard to remain American. The biggest of them is Florida. Florida's leaders have managed to protect for the most part, their constituents' constitutional rights even during the pandemic, while in a lot of places, those rights were canceled. Florida did not go into a total lockdown, many businesses and beaches stayed open. So what was the result of this? Well, according to our public policy expert, Anthony Fauci, Florida should be leading the country in coronavirus deaths, but that's not true. It's not even close. Florida has performed far better than states that shutdown completely and forced people to isolate, states like New York and New Jersey. Last summer at the height of the pandemic, New York and New Jersey had five times the number of coronavirus deaths on a per capita basis and far more people live in Florida than in New York or New Jersey. New York still has more corona cases per day than Florida does. Today, we've learned it's even worse than we thought in the northeast. It turns out the New York's Governor Andrew Cuomo sent more than 9,000 coronavirus patients from hospitals to nursing homes in the early days of the pandemic. Those numbers are almost twice as high as what we thought, twice as high as what officials had reported in New York. According to the ""New York Post,"" a top Cuomo aide has admitted, this was a cover-up. It was lying. Putting out the real numbers, he worried would be quote, "" ... used against us by Federal prosecutors and Donald Trump."" We will have more on that remarkable story tomorrow. All of this is uncomfortable for our media to talk about, for obvious reasons, and not just because CNN literally employs the brother of the governor of New York on TV. And it's not simply because Florida is run by Republicans for the most part. The key point is that Florida proves that people don't need to give up their rights as Americans just because some bureaucrat demands they do, just because some career politician wants more power. Now at MSNBC, which exists to protect career politicians, there's only one solution to this problem: Florida's leadership needs to be punished immediately. JOY REID, MSNBC HOST: Republican Governor Ron DeSantis cares more about keeping the state open for business than about keeping people alive. How do you roll out a national plan when you have to go through governors like him? Is there a way that the administration can get around people like Ron DeSantis? Really quickly, that what do you do with dumb governors? I'm sorry to put it this way. But you have governors like Ron DeSantis who don't care about COVID. What do you do with recalcitrant governors? Republican governors so eager to claw their way to the top of the Trumpian food chain, they have happily picked up his war against science and his lack of respect or reverence for life itself. CARLSON: The defenders of democracy there. Is there a way we can get around people like Ron DeSantis, people, meaning elected officials voted-in state- wide. In other words, how can the Federal government shut down the State of Florida and overthrow its governor? Well, the Biden administration is considering its options actually. They've come up apparently with a plan to punish Florida and its governor. According to ""The Miami Herald"" and we're quoting, ""The Biden administration is considering whether to impose domestic travel restrictions, including on Florida."" Anonymous White House source explained exactly what's going on here. This is a quote for the ages, listen, quote: ""This is a war and we are at battle with the virus. War is messy and unpredictable and all options are on the table."" What? All options are on the table? This is war. Who are you talking about? You're talking about American citizens. A rare moment of honesty from an anonymous White House official. No administration has ever suggested doing anything like this. The White House is singling out specific states for punishment. Today, Ron DeSantis made it clear that he knows what is going on here and will resist it. GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): I think it would be unconstitutional, it would be unwise, and it would be unjust. And if you think about it, restricting the right of Americans to travel freely throughout our country while allowing illegal aliens to pour across the southern border unmolested would be a ridiculous, but very damaging farce. So we will oppose it 100 percent. It would not be based in science, it would purely be a political attack against the people of Florida. CARLSON: So the pretext for shutting off Florida from the rest of the country is that there is a mutation of the coronavirus spreading in the state. Okay. That mutation is also spreading in California, the biggest Democratic state and yet no one in the White House is talking about destroying California or its Governor Gavin Newsom. Instead, they are defending Gavin Newsom from a democratic recall effort against voters. So Democrats know exactly what this is. It's punishment for the largest Republican state. Last March, when the White House floated a broader lockdown that would affect the northeast, the Governor of New York was apoplectic. He called it, quote, ""A Federal declaration of war."" A lockdown is what they did in Wuhan, China, declared the brother of CNN's anchor. We are not in China, and we're not in Wuhan. I believe it'd be illegal. He is actually probably right. But Democrats have changed their view. They have decided we are going to punish the state to which all the taxpayers in our big, failed, ugly, gray, dirty, crime ridden states are fleeing. These people are the most effective real estate salesman the State of Florida has ever seen, and they're punishing Florida for it. Marco Rubio represents the State of Florida in the United States Senate. He joins us now. Senator, I have to say, this seems -- given what's going on in California, I don't understand the scientific basis for a suggestion like this. It seems very obviously political punishment. How does it strike you? SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL): It's actually quite ironic. The day after Donald Trump imposed the China travel ban, Joe Biden accused him of xenophobia. Then in March, he tweeted out that travel bans against anywhere in the world do not work. But now he wants to impose them on American citizens. You know, tonight, if you arrive at the U.S. southern border with a child, you will be allowed entry to the country. You will be allowed to stay here pending an asylum trial that you may -- or hearing that you may never show up for. But if you're now an American citizen living in Florida that wants to travel, they're going to put some form of restriction in your way. I mean, it's clearly unconstitutional. But we should also pass a law here making clear that this is not within the power of an administration to do. That you can't just, you know, stand in the way of the ability of Americans to travel freely in their country, for something that by the way, is not supported by the science. CARLSON: It seems like A, a pretty radical thing to say; B, the kind of thing you might say if you wanted to stoke real conflict, make people really paranoid, make them feel like they are really under attack. Shutting off states from the rest of the country? What? I mean why would they even float an idea like that? RUBIO: Because I think they're trying to punish Florida. I think they're embarrassed by what Florida has done. Florida has embarrassed California. Florida has embarrassed New York. CARLSON: Yes. RUBIO: It hosted a Super Bowl with actual people in the stands. You know, the predictions about Florida didn't come true. And they're like, we can't let this stand. We've got to come up with something. I honestly think there's an element of that that involves punishment. I really do. CARLSON: So I mean, if you look at the State of New York, you know, we're not going to get the numbers for probably another year, but it looks to me very much checking the real estate numbers, like they're losing their tax base at very high speed for Florida. They must resent that. RUBIO: Absolutely. Well, not just from that, we've never had people move to Florida from California. They are coming from California. But look at the airlines, the airlines have rerouted a bunch of flights to Florida, to all kinds of communities. People are telling you what they think about what's going on in these states, and it's not just a pandemic, by the way. It's streets that are not livable anymore. Garbage that isn't being picked up. CARLSON: That's right. RUBIO: Anarchy in the streets. It's more than just a pandemic, the pandemic is terrible, but it has added to all these other -- schools that aren't open. I mean, there's kids in California that haven't gotten to school. I read these tweets about a lot of these kids that were high school football prospects who have lost their whole senior year. I mean, they're just stuck, all wiped out. And on top of that, they had a terrible record on COVID. CARLSON: So if you mismanage your state so completely that everyone with the job flees, should you -- RUBIO: You get an Emmy. CARLSON: Would you -- you get an Emmy. But should you allowed to force the rest of the country to bail you out? That's what they're going to try and do. RUBIO: Yes. And again, those are preexisting debts. We should not be in the business of saying, well, we were already in trouble to begin with. This is a good opportunity to get you a bunch of money, so we can help fund all the mismanagement, all the terrible union contracts you have, all the mess you've made of your cities or your state. That's exactly what they're looking for. This is not about helping a city that needs help, that's one thing. This is -- let me say their tax base was wiped out by the pandemic. This is about preexisting debt in the billions of dollars, pension plans that are bankrupting states and cities and counties across the country. And now they view the pandemic as the latest opportunity to get bailed out. CARLSON: Yes, unlike pretty much everyone else in Florida, you're from the State of Florida, so congratulations on that. You were in early. RUBIO: I am a native. CARLSON: Senator Rubio, great to see you. Thank you. RUBIO: Thank you. CARLSON: So if you doubt the public health experts, the people who want to shut down Florida for example, you risk losing your job. Last night, Disney made an example of a ""Star Wars"" actress who dared step out of line on social media. We'll tell you what happened straight ahead. CARLSON: Well, as you've noticed, if you've got the wrong politics, if you for example, oppose communism or don't fully trust public health experts who have no idea what they're doing and lie, you can be fired. Another example tonight, an actress in a popular Disney Plus ""Star Wars"" series is the latest to be fired. FOX's Trace Gallagher has that story for us tonight. Hey, Trace. TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Tucker, before she became an actress Gina Carano, a conservative was a mixed martial arts fighter and she has been criticized previously for posting political statements like mocking mask wearing and alleging there was voter fraud in the 2020 election. Now, she has been fired by Disney for an Instagram post that compares the political climate in Nazi Germany to what's happening today in the U.S. She wrote, quoting here, ""Most people today don't realize that to get to the point where Nazi soldiers could easily round up thousands of Jews, the government first made their own neighbors hate them simply for being Jews. How is that any different from hating someone for their political views?"" But the very same comparison was used two years ago by ""The Mandalorian's liberal star, Pedro Pascal, who posted pictures of children confined by barbed wire in 1944, Nazi Germany and children allegedly being confined in I.C.E. detention centers in 2018, except the picture isn't from the U.S., it is reportedly Palestinian children in the West Bank. So same sentiment, wrong picture, still employed. But now the Disney double standard is being questioned. The associate editor of ""The Daily Caller"" writes, quoting here: ""Gina Carano's post made the point that mass violence starts with hatred for your neighbor. This is not only uncontroversially true, but also one perspective of the commandment to love your neighbor."" Many others are simply canceling Disney Plus. Interesting that last month, Gina Carano said she stays vocal on social media because she has seen both sides of the aisle get bullied on Twitter. This time, it appears very one- sided -- Tucker. CARLSON: Trace Gallagher, thanks so much for that. Appreciate it. Matt Walsh is one of the smartest observers of all this stuff. He is the host of ""The Matt Walsh Show."" He joins us now. Matt, thanks so much for coming on. One of the reasons that this is particularly galling and ominous is that Disney, by and large is programmed to our kids. It's a right into the minds of our children. With that in mind, how do you assess this? MATT WALSH, HOST, ""THE MATT WALSH SHOW"": Yes, well, Disney has been radically leftist for a very long time, and so I think this is -- I'm glad to hear that people are canceling their Disney Plus subscriptions. This is something as conservatives, we have to start thinking, okay, there are there companies out there that are actively working against us in the culture. They are working against us. They're brainwashing our kids. They want to -- they want to turn our kids against us by the messages they are feeding them. Are we going to keep supporting these kinds of companies? So this is just one example. In this case, it's so absurd as we just covered there that I mean, the idea that a Nazi, a Holocaust or a Hitler comparison is now anti-Semitic. Well, if that's the case, then everybody on the internet is an anti-Semite because this is the most common rhetorical tactic that you find on the internet. And that's why I think that Gina Carano has not only a case of being canceled here, but this is defamation. I mean, Lucas Films came out and said that she was denigrating people for their religious beliefs. That is not -- that's not even an interpretation of what she said. That is just a lie about what she said. And so I think she should hopefully have her lawyer -- CARLSON: Can I clarify? I think, that's right. But I mean, she was anti- Nazi, right? She wasn't endorsing the Nazis. She was criticizing the Nazis. WALSH: Right, right. Yes, I guess the only way you could possibly interpret it as pro-Nazi is if you think that she was warning about hatred of your fellowman as -- but in fact, she was encouraging it, like it's a good thing, of course, that's not what she was doing. The point -- as far as Nazi comparisons go, this is one of the more legitimate ones we've seen, because the point she is making, she's not saying that right now, conservatives are being rounded up and sent to concentration camps. She is just saying that when you take a certain group of people, and we start demonizing them and dehumanizing them for their beliefs, it can lead to very bad places. And the ironic thing is that the left is now proving her point by the way they are reacting to her, making up these lies, calling her an anti-Semite. They know it's a lie. They know it is, and they're just saying it because they feel like, well, she deserves it because she's a cultural heretic, and she has the wrong views. So that's dehumanizing, when you think it is okay to defame someone because you disagree with their political views. So I think they've kind of proved her point in a lot of ways. CARLSON: When did everyone on one side get so ideological, that all that matters is you have to sort of bow before certain idols and then you get a pass to do whatever you want? I don't remember the country being like this a few years ago. WALSH: I think it has been a long process, and that's the thing. You talk about ideological, that's the thing about cancel culture. People need to understand that there is no cancel culture on the right, like the right doesn't have a cancel culture because in order to cancel someone, you have to have institutional power. You have to have -- We hear so much on the left about systemic power. In fact, they say that you can't be a racist unless you have systemic power. That, of course, is ridiculous, because racism is just an internal heart thing. But canceling someone takes power. You have to have systemic institutional power to cancel someone, and only the left really has that. So actually, cancel culture is a left-wing phenomenon. They are the only ones who do it, and it is intensely ideological. That's the number one thing that determines whether you're going to be canceled is your political views. CARLSON: Yes, I think that's exactly right. Matt Walsh, great to see you tonight. Thank you. WALSH: Thanks a lot. CARLSON: Cancel culture. It is happening everywhere. At some point, it will end and I do think that the people who stood up in the face of it will get the credit they deserve. And some of those people are the ones who own and run this. Whatever you think of FOX News, the people who run this place are tough and principled, and that's why we're still here. I wouldn't say it if it weren't true. It is true. It's demonstrably true. We're still here. Thank God. Well, Joe Biden's State Department has identified a new national security threat, not Iran or China or Russia. No, it is you. We've obtained internal State Department documents that describe the terrible threat that you pose to America. That's straight ahead. CARLSON: If you were looking for an honest assessment of the national security threats we face, George Soros might be on that list somewhere. George Soros makes your country weaker. Sorry, that's true. He's made a lot of countries weaker. In 1992, George Soros famously shorted the British pound and nearly broke the Bank of England. He then contributed to the 1997 Asian financial crisis that brought down the Bank of Thailand. So if you were asking someone to assess national security threats, you probably wouldn't ask George Soros because he kind of seems like one. He'll scream and make noises, because we said that, but again, how is that not true? It is true. But the Biden administration does not agree with that. Clearly, they love George Soros, and here's evidence of that fact. Joe Biden's State Department, we learned yesterday held a virtual event called Discussion on Racism Being a National Security Threat. According to a State Department documented that this show obtained exclusively, one of the speakers there was Tom Perriello. Who is that? Well, he is the head of George Soros' foundation in the United States. Now, presumably Tom Perriello didn't want anyone to know where he works or warn anyone about his boss. So he said the real threat that we face, according to this lecture at the State Department is racism. Oh, in other words, your attitudes, because if you disagree with them, they call you a racist even if you spend your whole life trying your hardest to be colorblind and adhere to the principles, the meritocracy, the American principles that make this country possible. No, you're a racist if they disagree with you. In other words, the real problem Tom Perriello explained, the State Department apparently agrees is America itself. America's police officers, political opponents, the Democratic Party. Joe Biden has basically said this out loud in recent weeks. Here's an example. JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We've taken steps to acknowledge and address systemic racism and the scourge of white supremacy in our own country. And yes, forces to confront systemic racism and white supremacy. It's just been weeks since all America witnessed a group of thugs, insurrectionists, political extremists and white supremacists violently attack the capital of our democracy. I believe we're in a battle for the soul of this nation, and the simple truth is, our soul will be troubled as long as systemic racism is allowed to persist. CARLSON: You can't call Biden a liar because that assumes he has any idea what he is saying, which of course he doesn't, he is reading off a cue card written by somebody else, but you do wish somebody in power would define the term systemic racism for us. What exactly is systemic racism? Can it be measured? Are there studies on that? What the hell are you talking about? And of course, they'll never define it, because it's not real, at least in the sense that they use it. And if it were real, then why would people be moving here from non-white countries? Obviously, why would they be encouraging immigration into this country, if this country was controlled by systemic racism? That would be dangerous to the people coming here, because they don't believe what they're saying. This is a way to get you to be quiet and for them to draw more power to themselves. Well, just in case that it wasn't already completely clear to you, and it should be completely clear to you. Then, we've also learned that the virtual meeting was held on Zoom. Oh, Zoom, the State Department is holding meetings on Zoom. Well, last year, an indictment revealed that Zoom had an agreement with the government of China to spy on meetings conducted by its users. Court documents showed that Zoom proactively monitored meetings that might upset the Communist Party of China and in some cases, shut down calls at the Chinese government's request. As you'd expect, China did not shut down yesterday's meeting of the State Department. It accomplished everything they wanted. Our leaders weren't paying attention to actual threats. They were casting aspersions on their own population, dividing America. Well, this is a genre story we can't get enough of. Last year, Seattle City Council Member Kshama Sawant wanted to defund the police. You know what happens next? What always happens when you do that? In December, she had help from police because she started receiving threatening e-mails. Of course now, she is complaining the police haven't done enough about it. Oh, they're still our police and she wants them working on her personal concerns. Jason Rantz is a Seattle radio show host. He has been on top of the story. He joins us tonight to gloat. Jason, good to see you. Explain this story, the defund-the-police lady is now mad that the still funded police aren't doing enough for her personally? JASON RANTZ, SEATTLE RADIO SHOW HOST: Yes, she's not getting the VIP treatment that she so obviously deserves. So she got these threats. She didn't actually report them to the police. She put out a press statement. But obviously when the SPD found out about them, they started the investigation. About two weeks in, they kept her abreast of the situation, not giving her too much because these were e-mail threats and they have to actually do some tracing. They believe that -- we believe that there's some spoofing of e-mails that were the case here, so they actually have to dig in. This doesn't happen overnight. They are doing what they can, but she thinks they are dragging their feet. They're not doing it fast enough. This is a single detective in a department that is under resourced because of Kshama Sawant in a department that now has one of the lowest staffing levels it has seen in several decades. There's a reason why they might be a little bit slow, but still, they're doing what they can. On top of that she does not understand how policing works. She is taking issue with some of the questions she is being asked by the detective. Now again, these are e-mail threats. She's mad that the detective asked her how she felt, having received these e-mail threats, not realizing that when you get threatening e-mails, again, that is the theme here, you have to establish you actually had a reasonable, threatening feeling, right? She is mad that they're trying to establish a crime had occurred. You can watch a single episode of ""Law and Order"" literally any of them and understand that about policing. So as she is focusing exclusively on trying to fire all these officers, she should probably understand how they do their jobs because then she probably wouldn't be complaining about all of this. CARLSON: If you defund the police, you should be exempt from police protection. Like you defund the police, no police protection for you. I don't understand this. I mean, this is too frustrating. RANTZ: Yes. CARLSON: Hard to believe you live there. Good luck, Jason Rantz. Thank you. RANTZ: Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON: So even as they try and take away your protection, they also simultaneously try to prevent you from protecting yourself. Mark and Patricia McCloskey are living examples of that. They are facing felony charges for defending their home from violent threats from BLM. We want to bring him an update on the story. We're going to talk to Mark McCloskey, directly after the break. CARLSON: Last summer, Mark and Patricia McCloskey were having dinner in their backyard in St. Louis when a group of BLM rioters broke the gate and went up on their property and threatened to kill them. The McCloskeys did what they should have done, what everybody should do and what every American has the right to do: they defended their property and their lives. MARK MCCLOSKEY, ST. LOUIS RESIDENT WHO DEFENDED HIS HOME: Keep moving. Keep moving. Keep moving. Let's go. [CROWD SHOUTING] CARLSON: Keep in mind, it is their house. They didn't do anything wrong. They're just having dinner at their house and these lunatics show up and threatened to kill them. So they tell people to back off and they use firearms to do it. They were immediately attacked by everyone. ""The Washington Post"" tried to ruin their life, and nobody defended them. The NRA, which exists to defend the legal right of gun owners to defend their lives and property, totally ignored them and still has to this day. And of course, the legal system in St. Louis, totally political has just tried to destroy them. The McCloskeys are facing charges for unlawful use of a weapon and tampering with evidence and they face up to four years in prison each. So as crime rises around the country, we thought tonight would be a good night to check in with Mark McCloskey to see how things are going in that case. Mark McCloskey, thanks so much for joining us tonight. What's the status of your legal fight? MCCLOSKEY: That's for having me, Tucker. Well, we're still charged with two felonies. It'll cost us four years in prison if convicted. The judges in our cases have thrown the Circuit Attorney off the case because she used us in her campaign advertising and the judge has ruled that -- she gave the impression that she was charging us for political purposes. She was attempting to inflame the potential jury pool, meaning our peers, accusing us of being -- of having racial motivations and impinging our character based on our wealth, our social position, and the judge has concluded that she gave the impression of having jeopardized our rights to a fair trial. And she has been taken off the case, but she is still fighting to get back on. I mean, both trial judges ruled against her. The Court of Appeals ruled against her. We don't know if she is going to take us up to the Missouri Supreme Court. But just to show how apolitical she was, she didn't want to let go with this. CARLSON: Scary. I don't think most people in this category care what color you are, how much money you have. As an American, you have a right to protect yourself on your own property from a violent mob threatening your life. Has any -- and that's why I think this case is so important because it's not even about you, it is about all of us. Has anyone stepped forward to help you? I know the NRA has been completely absent. Wayne LaPierre took a pass on this for reasons, someday, I hope he explains. But has anybody else stepped up to support you? MCCLOSKEY: You know, we have got a lot of support, generally around the country, but as far as actually helping us, well, we've got the Governor of Missouri who has vowed to pardon us if we get convicted, but we have to get convicted first. Our State Attorney General has filed a motion to dismiss, which has not yet been ruled on. But as far as the local government here, we're out there in our wild lonesome. CARLSON: What is this costing you? And are you worried not just for yourself but for the country? MCCLOSKEY: The country, Tucker, is in such a world of hurt. I mean, we have got, as now my representative in the House of Congress, we've got Cori Bush, who led this mob to my house not just once on June 28th, but twice, again, on July the 3rd, and on July the 3rd, the curb mob was expressly there to kill us and burn down our house. And she is standing out in front of my house with a megaphone chanting, ""You can't stop the revolution."" She has the gall to stand up in Congress and say that anybody that supports insurrection should not be allowed to be in the Halls of Congress. My God. She has advocated revolution in front of me and her organization, Expect US in St. Louis has vowed to kill us and burn down our house. The hypocrisy is just absolutely amazing. CARLSON: And you didn't even do anything. I mean, you're just a lawyer having dinner with your wife, and because they didn't like the way you looked. MCCLOSKEY: They broke down the gate. They come in. They are hundreds of them screaming, shouting, threatening, and all we did was keep them at bay. Not a shot was fired. Nobody died. CARLSON: You did the right thing. Yes, well -- it's amazing that anyone is even questioning what you did, much less trying to prosecute you for it. Mark McCloskey, Godspeed. I appreciate your coming on tonight. Thank you. MCCLOSKEY: Thank you, Tucker. CARLSON: We will be back tomorrow night at 8:00 p.m., the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. Sean Hannity takes over now. SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: It is amazing how long that case has gone on under the circumstances. I am glad you're following up. Thanks, Tucker. Good show. CARLSON: Thank you. HANNITY: Thank you.
